STILL-ROOM</i></h2>

<hr class="full" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<p>A PLEA FOR HOUSEWIFERY</p>
<hr class="full2" />
<hr class="full" />

<p class='drop-cap'>WE live in an age which may well be
called the age of the purveyor; and,
if we continue travelling along the
road upon which we have entered, the
time cannot be far distant when it will be held
ridiculous to do anything at all for ourselves. To
appreciate, to criticize, to display taste in selection—these
are the hall-marks of to-day, and home is
but another name for a private restaurant. Homes
such as those in which Goldsmith and Dickens
delighted are now calculated to bring a blush to the
cheeks of the superior and the “artistic.” Of few
of our fine ladies can it be said that “they are
excellent Housewives, and as capable of descending
to the kitchen with propriety as of acting in their
exalted stations with dignity.”</p>

<p>We are nowadays far more willing to applaud
and reward the woman who throws her “Letters”—real
or imaginary—before the eyes of the bored
and lazy world, than the one who is merely efficient
in the sphere allotted to her sex by nature. An
occasional grant, such as Stow records as being
made by Henry VIII., would do much to remedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the position of the housewife. King Henry’s grant
was of an estate in Leadenhall Street to “<i>Mistris
Cornewallies, widdow, and her heires, in reward of
Fine Puddings by her made</i>.”</p>

<p>But suppers have gone out—not the midnight
meals of the Strand and Piccadilly—cider has gone
out, and home-cured hams, with home-brewed ale
and home-stilled cordials, have gone the way of
Mrs. Primrose’s gooseberry wine and Mr. Frank
Churchill’s spruce beer.</p>

<p>Little economies are now as unfashionable as
quiet generosity, hospitality, and comfort. If it is
not beneath the dignity of a man to spend enjoyable
hours of labour in laboratory or malthouse, in
sick-ward or workshop, woman need not feel degraded
by the apportionment to her of those duties
which are more immediately bound up with the
creation of happy and refreshing homes.</p>

<p>A private latch-key is no doubt part of the
universal birthright, but it does not in itself afford
a sufficient aim in life. To be able to discourse
cleverly of Browning and Wagner is an accomplishment
easily acquired, and affords pleasure to no one.
To acquire a reputation for the excellence of our
home-made gooseberry wine, of our home-baked
bread, or of our home-brewed beer is much more
difficult and much more worthy. There is more
scope for the use of brains in housewifery than in
almost any of the other careers open to women,
and this possibly is why so many women are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a><br /><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
fighting shy of it. In housewifery there can be but
little pretence, for no ignorance may remain hid.
Bluff and a ready tongue or pen go a long way
towards creating many a “brilliant reputation” in
the “artistic” and vapid world which lives at
clubs and restaurants, and runs societies for improving
other people. But no bluff will ever avail
in the presence of the food or drink in the preparation
of which our skill has been employed.
The products of housewifery speak for themselves;
they are no empty expressions of sentiments which
may be false or true.</p>

<div class="caption">SYMBOLS OF DISTILLATION.<br />(<i>From Baker’s “Jewell of Health,” 1576.</i>)</div>
</div>

<p>In no way, indeed, can affection be displayed
with more subtle grace and delicacy than by the
thoughtfulness of the housewife. The greatest of
poets has no such instrument at his command.
Not that women, in order to be efficient in their
homes, need be ignorant of the events and thoughts
which are in progress outside. Quite otherwise,
they should be able to be the boon companions of
men. But what I would urge is that they should
take over as their share of the necessary work of
mankind the management of that department which
is immediately associated with domestic life. In
this there is nothing degrading. For, after all, it
is housewifery to which nearly all the arts and
sciences bring their secrets. Home and comfort,
food and drink—it will be a long time before we
can get quite away from the need of these things.
To introduce science and order into the domestic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a><br /><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>kingdom is a task worthy of the finest intellect;
and that woman who by the use of brains organizes
and systematizes her household work is she who
can best front with a smiling face the difficulty of
obtaining servants—which appears to be the great
omnipresent trouble of Englishwomen.</p>

(<i>From Baker’s “Jewell of Health,” 1576.</i>)</div>
</div>

<p>In his summary of the “inward and outward
vertues which ought to be in a compleate woman,”
Gervase Markham laid it down that she must be
“of chast thought, stout courage, patient, untyred,
watchfull, diligent, witty, pleasant, constant in
friendship, full of good Neighbourhood, wise in
discourse, but not frequent therein, sharpe and
quicke of speech, but not bitter or talkative, secret
in affaires, comfortable in her counsels, and generally
skilfull in the worthy knowledges which doe belong
to her Vocation.” Later he says that, of all these
“outward and active knowledges,” “the first and
most principall is a perfect skill and knowledge in
Cookery, together with all the secrets belonging to
the same, because it is a duty rarely belonging to a
woman; and shee that is utterly ignorant therein,
may not by the Lawes of strict Justice challenge
the freedome of marriage, because indeede shee
can then but performe halfe her vow; for she may
love and obey, but shee cannot cherish, serve, and
keepe him with that true duty which is ever
expected.” The work that is most personal and
nearest to our hand may be the most important and
most valuable after all. It may also, as has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a><br /><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
said, be the finest and most dignified if we approach
it in the right spirit.</p>

<div class="caption">ALCHEMIST PERFORMING MYSTIC RITES.

(<i>From Baker’s “Jewell of Health,” 1576.</i>)</div>
</div>

<p>The chipping away of the gross and unessential,
with the consequent liberation of the true and fine,
is as noble a process in cookery as in sculpture.
Yet how different is the attitude of even the
humblest artist in words or marble or paint towards
his material and his work from that of the average
housewife towards the flavours and fragrances which
she is privileged to elucidate and to blend. It is a
ludicrous thing that women cry out for spheres
in which to display their power. And all these
centuries they have been entrusted with the practice
of an art with almost boundless possibilities, yet
scarcely any of them have proved capable of rising
above the status of artisans in that craft. Equally,
one looks in vain for the Roger Bacons, the Harveys,
the Darwins, or the Hubers of the kitchen. The
processes of cooking do not seem to inspire women
with any of the wonder, religion, and scientific zeal
such as almost every branch of labour has inspired
in man. Mechanically and brainlessly the recipes
of the cookery books are followed by myriads of
women everywhere, so that the compounding of
foods and drinks is usually as uninteresting a piece
of drudgery as can be conceived. One may well
pray for a reaction, if indeed the art of housewifery
is not past praying for.</p>

<h2>BUTTER AND CREAM</h2>
<hr class="full2" />
<hr class="full" />


<p class='drop-cap'>AS a volume of the present series will be
devoted to the subject of The Dairy,
which is too large a subject to be treated
usefully in a single chapter, I shall here
merely record such facts and formulæ as may be of
help to those who have a general knowledge of
dairy work, and also offer a little advice of a
practical kind to those who have to deal with
dairying on the smallest scale. A larder or store-room
should never be used for the storage of milk,
as the conditions required are somewhat different,
and also because, more than almost any other
substance, milk absorbs and is spoilt by any strong
smell such as many stores yield to the air about
them. The milk-room should be cool, only
moderately light, well ventilated and somewhat
dry, and should, if possible, face the east or north.
There must be no possibility of gas from drain or
manure heap coming into contact with the milk
at any stage, either in milking-yard or dairy. The
floor should be of tiles or concrete, and the shelves
should be of slate or stone. The room and all
vessels used should be kept scrupulously clean. If a
separator is used, the milk should be put through
the machine as soon as possible after milking, as
the milk should have a temperature of about 90° F.
If the cream is to be separated by “setting,” the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
milk should be taken straight to the dairy as soon
as possible after milking, and poured through a hair
sieve or other strainer into shallow pans—about
four to six inches deep. These should be kept
at a temperature of between 46° and 56° F. In
from twenty-four to thirty-six hours, according to
the season (more quickly in summer), the cream is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
separated by a flat perforated skimmer, or the milk
is drawn off by a syphon, or by the removal of a
plug. If skimmed, the process is repeated twelve
hours later, and occasionally a third time after a
similar period has elapsed. If clotted cream be
desired, the pans—about six to eight inches deep—of
milk, having stood in the dairy for twenty-four
hours, are heated over a furnace or in a water-bath
to a temperature of 175° F., and then again restored
to the dairy to cool. The cream is then skimmed
off the milk by means of the skimmer. If the cream
is to be made into butter, it must be “ripened,”
but must not be allowed to become too sour. In
summer, it must not be kept for more than two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
days, and in winter for not more than four days.
It should be placed, as soon as separated, in an
earthenware cream-holder, large enough to hold
the entire cream to be used at a single churning.
When adding the cream from subsequent skimmings,
thoroughly stir the whole together. Keep the
cream cool until twenty-four hours before churning,
and add no fresh cream to the mixture within
twelve hours of the churning in summer, or within
twenty-four hours in winter. For the twenty-four
hours previous to churning, the cream must be kept
at a temperature of about 60° F. In summer, churn
at a temperature of from 57° to 59° F., and in
winter at from 59° to 63° F. The room, the
churn, and the cream should all be of about the
same temperature. The cream should be strained
through straining muslin into the churn, and the
latter should be not more than half full. Churn
rather slowly for the first five minutes, and allow
the gas to escape frequently, until no air rushes out
when the vent is opened. Directly you hear the
butter form or “break,” open the churn and see
that it has come. It will resemble mustard seed.
Add for each gallon of cream a quart of cold water,
and slowly turn the churn for about half a minute.
Draw off the butter-milk, add to the butter the
same quantity of cold water as there was originally
of cream, give the churn a few turns quickly, and
then draw off the water. Repeat this process until
the water comes away quite clear. Then take the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
butter out of the churn, place it on the worker,
allow it to drain for quarter of an hour, and then
work the whole mass together. Weigh it, and
dredge over it from a quarter to three-quarters of
an ounce of fine pure salt to the pound of butter,
rolling it out and sprinkling the salt evenly and
by degrees. Well roll it so as to mix the salt
uniformly, and get rid of all the water, but do not
overwork it. Place the butter in a cool place for
six hours to harden before being made up. The
hands should never touch the milk, cream, or
butter at any stage; a thermometer should be used
to measure the various temperatures of which knowledge
is required; and the churn, worker, wooden
hands, and other appliances should be prepared for
use by first rinsing them with cold water, then
scalding them with boiling water, rubbing them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
thoroughly with salt, and lastly rinsing them again
with cold water.—<i>H. R.</i></p>

<p><i>To pot Butter.</i>—The great secret in potting
butter so that it will keep is to extract from it every
drop of superfluous milk. This should be done
either by working the butter thoroughly with a pair
of the wooden “hands,” or spatulas, used in all good
dairies instead of the human hand, or by immersing
the butter in hot water. In the latter case the milk
will fall to the bottom, leaving the butter floating
on the surface of the water. The butter should be
packed in layers in an earthenware jar or crock, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
little salt being sprinkled upon each layer. If this
process is carefully carried out the butter will keep
well. Another method is to make a pickle by
pouring a quart of boiling water upon two pounds
of salt, two ounces of loaf sugar, and one ounce of
saltpetre. Let this stand till perfectly cold. Then
put the butter into a jar, and keep it well covered
with the pickle. Butter thus treated will keep
sweet and firm throughout the hottest summer.</p>

<h2>CHEESE</h2>
<hr class="full2" />
<hr class="full" />


<p class="drop-cap">IT is quite impossible here to give more than the
merest outline of the steps taken in preparing
the various sorts of cheese manufactured in
this country. The processes will, moreover,
be more fully described in a future volume of this
series. Meanwhile, the reader may be advised to
study the three pamphlets issued by the Royal
Agricultural Society dealing with the practices of
making Cheddar, Cheshire, and Stilton cheeses
respectively. A brief summary may, however, be
useful to those who can supplement this by a few
actual observations of practical cheese-making by
skilful operators.</p>

<p>In some ways, and by many connoisseurs, Stilton
is considered the finest of English cheeses. The first
step in its manufacture is the addition of Hansen’s
(or other) rennet, at the rate of one drachm to four
gallons, to the fresh-strained milk when the milk
has a temperature of from 80° to 85° F., the making-room
being kept at a temperature of about 60° F.
The whole is well stirred in a vat for eight minutes.
When, in an hour so, the milk has completely turned,
and the curd is ready for cutting and ladling, straining
cloths, from thirty-six to forty-five inches square,
are placed in earthenware curd-sinks, rods being used
to support the sides. The curd is then ladled out
of the vat by means of a half-gallon ladle, and about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
three gallons of curd are placed in each straining
cloth, the plugs of the curd-sinks being in position.
When the curd has stood for an hour and a half,
open the plugs, drain off the whey, replace the plugs,
tie the straining cloths, and tighten them every
two hours until night, drawing off the whey each
time. Then empty the curd on to the curd-tray,
and leave it all night. On the next morning
draw off the whey, cut the curd into three-inch
cubes, and leave it to drain for a couple of hours.
The milk from the next milking is treated in
like manner. On the afternoon of the second
day the two curds are thoroughly mixed together,
broken up to the size of large filberts, salted at
the rate of an ounce to three and a half pounds
of curd, and placed into cheese hoops placed
on round pieces of wood covered with “cheese
greys.” The hoops are put on the drainer, and
turned every two hours during the first day by
means of loose calico-covered discs over their top
surfaces, similar to those which served as their basis.
The temperature of the room whilst draining is
going on must be about five decrees higher than
that of the making-room. After the first day the
cheeses are turned three times daily. In about a
week the cheese can stand alone, and should be
removed from the hoops, calico binders taking their
place. The cheeses are still to be kept on the
draining shelves, fresh binders being applied daily;
the outside of the cheese being gently scraped with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
a table knife at each binding. As soon as a dry
crust begins to form, the binders are to be removed.
The cheeses are to be kept at a temperature of about
55° F., and given plenty of air. They require
turning daily. In about a month the cheeses are
to be placed in a dark store-room having a temperature
of 60° to 65° F., and are to be turned and
brushed daily. In about six months they are fit for
the table.</p>

<p>In making Cheddar cheese, the night’s milk is
placed in a vat, and left until the following morning,
being kept fairly cool. If much cream has risen by
the morning, this must be skimmed off, added to the
morning’s milk, and well stirred. The morning’s
milk must then be heated by the pan being placed
in a vessel containing hot water until its temperature
is raised to a point not far short of, but never exceeding,
95° F. The evening’s milk is then added to it,
and the joint temperature brought to about 80° to
85° F. Rennet is added, as in the case of Stilton
cheese. In about an hour, when the curd breaks
readily and clearly, as if cut, the curd is to be cut
by a long thin knife into two-inch cubes. In about
five minutes the curd is to be further broken up for
about fifty minutes by the “breaker” until the
pieces are of the size of peas, the whey keeping
green all the while. Allow the whey to drain and
separate for five or ten minutes, when it should be
partly baled or syphoned off, heated to 130° F., and
returned so as to raise the total temperature to 90° to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
95° F., the curd being well stirred during the return
of the heated whey, which process should be gradual,
extending over ten minutes or more. The whey
should now rest above the hard and shotty curd,
which sinks to the bottom of the vat. In about a
quarter of an hour the whey is drawn off, the curd
is cut up, and the pieces are piled in a mound.
Keep it warm by covering it with cloths, and in a
quarter of an hour again cut it into pieces, turn it,
and arrange it afresh in a mound. It is again
covered for half an hour, then removed to a cooler,
cut into small pieces, and covered for another half
an hour. This is often again and again repeated
until the curd is ripe for grinding. The curd having
been ground, pure salt at the rate of an ounce to
three pounds should be carefully dredged over, and
mixed into it. The curd should then be placed in
the cloth-lined moulds, and subjected to the press
for twelve hours. The cloth is then changed, the
cheese turned, and again pressed for twenty-four
hours. This is repeated for four days, when the
cheese is finally removed from the mould, bandaged
after the manner of Stilton, and kept in a temperature
of 65° to 70° F. for six weeks, being turned
daily the while, and then in a temperature of 60°
to 65° F., when it is turned on alternate days for
another six or eight weeks.</p>

<p><i>Cream Cheese.</i>—There are several soft cheeses
well worth the attention of the small dairy owner.
Simple cream cheese is the easiest of all, for one has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
only to take a quart of thick cream, put it with two
drops of rennet into a napkin which has been freshly
rinsed out in cold spring water, and sprinkle a little
salt over it. Tie up the cream in the napkin as
tightly as possible, and hang it up in the dairy.
It may be eaten in twenty-four hours. The napkin
must be changed at night, and again in the morning,
for a fresh one wrung out in cold water. When
the cream cheese comes out of the dining-room, it
must be again tied up in a clean damp napkin and
taken immediately to the dairy.</p>

<p><i>Grewelthorp Cream Cheese</i> is equally simple in its
manufacture. Take one quart of new milk, and
put it with a few drops of rennet in a warm place,
where it must remain for twenty-four hours. Then
put in a little salt, stir the milk well, tie it up in a
cloth, and hang it up in the dairy to drain. If a
richer cheese is required, add half a pint of cream
to the new milk.</p>

<p>A number of soft cheeses may be made with the
help of some tinned iron cylindrical moulds open
at both ends. These moulds may be of various
diameters and depths. Some loose squares of wood,
some entire and others perforated, of various sizes,
to serve as bottoms and tops of the moulds, must
also be provided; and straw mats of the same size
as the boards are also desirable. A good average
size for the moulds is five inches in diameter, and
four inches in depth. About two quarts of milk
are required to make one cheese for this size mould.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p><i>To make Camembert</i>, the rennet diluted with
water is added to milk of a temperature of about
85° F., and the whole is stirred for three minutes.
It is then covered for about four hours, until no
curd adheres to the finger when placed on its
surface. The curd is then ladled in slices into the
moulds, each mould being placed on a straw mat,
with a board below, resting on a sloping table.
The full moulds are allowed to drain for about six
hours in a temperature of 60° F. A clean mat and
board are then placed at the top of the mould, the
latter inverted, and the previous base removed and
cleaned. Repeat this changing and inversing twice
a day for two days. Then remove the cheeses from
the moulds, sprinkle some salt on top and bottom,
and stand them on straw or straw-mats in a temperature
of about 50° to 55° F., a free current of air being
carried through the drying-room. The cheeses require
turning each morning and evening for another
three days, then every morning for a week, and
afterwards on alternate days. In about a fortnight,
when the cheeses cease to stick to the hand when
touched, they are put in a cool (about 50° F.),
dark, slightly damp cellar to ripen for about another
fortnight, being turned on alternate days.</p>

<p><i>Gervais Cheese.</i>—Messrs. Long and Morton, in
their book “The Dairy,” give directions for preparing
a Mignon or Gervais. This cheese is made of a
mixture of cream and milk set at a temperature of
65° F. Six drops of Hansen’s rennet are sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
for two and a half quarts of milk and one quart of
cream. The curd is fit to cut in from six to eight
hours, when it is removed into a cloth, in which
it is allowed to drain until it is sufficiently solid
and consistent to press.</p>

<p>Removed into a clean cloth, it is laid within
a wooden frame with open sides, and pressed with
a close-fitting follower of wood, heavy enough to
cause the whey to drain away without any loss of
cream. This pressure, with one or two manipulations,
with the object of maintaining evenness of
consistence, continues until the curd is as thick as
an ice cream, when it is pressed into specially made
paper-lined moulds. It may be eaten about three
days later.</p>

<p><i>To pot Cheese.</i>—A pleasant form of potted food is
made by pounding together in a mortar a pound of
cheese, three ounces of quite fresh butter, and half
a table-spoonful each of castor sugar and made
mustard. This mixture should be packed in jars,
covered with clarified butter, and securely covered.
It should not be kept longer than a fortnight.</p>

<h2>PICKLING MEAT</h2>
<hr class="full2" />
<hr class="full" />


<p class="drop-cap">IN pickling or salting meat, it is better to let the
fresh joint first hang for two or three days
untouched. This will make the meat more
tender. Before salting it, be careful to remove
every pipe or kernel in the meat, and fill up
all holes with salt. Do not attempt to pickle meat
in very cold frosty weather, or in warm damp
weather. It is a good plan to sprinkle the meat
with water and then to hang it up for a few hours
before salting it: this cleanses it from any blood,
and makes the flavour more delicate.</p>

<p>A good brine, sufficient for twenty pounds of
beef, is made by mixing together three pounds of
salt, three-quarters of a pound of sugar, and two
ounces of saltpetre. Boil these ingredients together
for twenty minutes in two gallons of water, skimming
off all scum. Let the liquid get quite cold
before you pour it over the meat, and see that the
joint is thoroughly covered with the brine. For a
smaller piece of meat the quantities given for the
brine can be easily reduced, following the same
proportions carefully. The meat must be turned
over every day, and well basted with the brine;
and the salting pan or tub must be covered with a
clean piece of tamis-cloth, or other porous woollen
material. The meat will be ready for use in a
fortnight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>In cooking pickled or salted meat, two things
must be recollected. First, that, in order to make
salted meat tender, it must be put into cold water
when first placed on the fire. Secondly, that it is
next to impossible to cook salted meat too slowly.</p>

<p><i>Spiced Round of Beef.</i>—Procure a round of beef
weighing from thirty-five to forty pounds; remove
the bone, and lay the beef in a stone pan. Well
rub into the meat all over (not omitting the sides of
the round as well as the top and bottom) a mixture
made of four pounds of salt, two pounds of coarse
brown sugar, a quarter of a pound of saltpetre, and
two ounces of <i>sal prunella</i> from the chemist. Turn
the beef every day, and well rub into it the brine
which it makes. Let it remain in pickle for one
month. When ready for cooking, let the beef be
closely bound into shape with coarse webbing.
Lay it in a large kettle or pot, and cover the beef
with broth as cold as it can be to remain liquid.
Add plenty of rough vegetables, such as carrots,
turnips, onions, and celery, all sliced. Dry in the
oven a sufficient quantity of ginger, cloves, mace,
and peppercorns to make two ounces of each when
dried and pounded fine in a mortar. Add these to
the beef. Bring the broth slowly to a very gentle
boil, and then keep it simmering very gently for
twelve hours, turning the beef over at the end of
six hours. It must on no account be allowed to
boil, or it will be hard and tasteless. Remove the
kettle from the fire, but let the beef remain in it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
for two days, when it will have become perfectly
cold and firm. Take off the webbing, and the
beef will be ready for eating.</p>

<p><i>Welsh Beef.</i>—Rub two ounces of saltpetre into
a round of beef; let it rest an hour, and then rub
it with equal parts of pepper, salt, and allspice.
Keep the beef in the brine which this will make
for fifteen days, turning and rubbing it every day.
Then put the beef into a large earthenware round
pan, first coating the bottom of the pan with a
layer of suet. Put another layer of suet over the
top of the beef, and then cover the pan with a
coarse paste of flour and water. Bake in a slow
oven for eight hours, then pour off any gravy, and
let the beef get cold before it is taken out of the
pan.</p>

<p><i>To make Sausages.</i>—Sausages are generally put into
the thoroughly cleaned skins of the intestine of the
pig. But they are sometimes preferred without
this covering. Take two pounds of fresh pork,
using both fat and lean in equal proportions, but
avoiding the coarse fat from the inside of the pig.
Mince the pork as finely as possible, and then pass
it twice through the mincing machine. Blanch
and mince two dessert-spoonfuls of sage, add four
ounces of freshly made bread-crumbs, and season
with pepper and a dust of salt. Mix all thoroughly
together, and keep the sausage-meat in a cool place.
When wanted do not use skins, but form the
sausage-meat into small round cakes three-quarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of an inch thick, flour them, and fry them in
butter from ten to fifteen minutes, turning them
often.</p>

<p><i>To cook Sausages.</i>—This recipe is for sausages
which have been put into skins by the sausage
machine. Plenty of time must be allowed for
cooking the sausages, for if they are done too
quickly the skins will burst. About ten minutes
is enough over a low fire, the skins having been
well pricked over first. The sausages are much
better if they are first pricked, then put into hot
water and brought slowly to the boil, simmered for
five minutes, drained, and finally fried in bacon fat
till they are brown. Serve round a pile of mashed
potato, or shape the mashed potato into long ovals,
fake them on a buttered baking-tin, and when very
hot, lay the potato ovals on a hot dish, and put a
sausage on each.</p>

<p><i>Ham.</i>—Tastes vary much as to the best size of a
ham; some people like a York ham weighing thirty
or forty pounds, others prefer a foreign ham not
exceeding a few pounds in weight. Monsieur
de St. Simon, writing in 1721, said he could never
forget the delicious flavour of the little Spanish
hams he had once tasted near Burgos. The pigs
which furnished these hams lived on the flesh of
vipers, and in our own day the hams of the little
black pigs of North Carolina, which feed on rattlesnakes,
are esteemed an especial delicacy. The
peculiar flavour of a Westphalian ham is due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the smoke of a fire of juniper branches over which
the ham is hung for three weeks.</p>

<p>It was formerly the custom to put a thick coat
of mortar over the inside of a cured ham to keep
out the air, and to prevent the mildew, or “rust,”
which damp is sure to cause. A better way is to
cover the underneath portion of the ham (where
the knife has been used), and also the knuckle-end
of the bone, with a paste made of flour and water.
This paste entirely prevents any “rusting,” or, in
other words, the minute fungus caused by damp.</p>

<p><i>To cure a Ham weighing from fifteen to eighteen
pounds. Norfolk Recipe.</i>—One pound of treacle,
half a pound of coarse brown sugar, half a pound of
bay-salt (<i>i.e.</i> sea-salt), one pound of common salt,
one ounce of saltpetre, and two ounces of <i>sal
prunella</i> (<i>i.e.</i> saltpetre which has been fused, and is
sold by chemists). Pound all these together as
finely as possible, and rub the ham thoroughly with
them. Lay the ham in a tub, covered with the
pickle, and let it remain there for a month. It
must be turned and basted with the pickle every
other day. When taken out of the pickle, let the
ham dry for a day or two, standing on end. Then
brush it over with Crosse and Blackwell’s essence
of smoke. This preparation gives to the ham all
the flavour of the chimney-smoke in which hams
used to be hung. [This recipe was given to me
by a friend in whose family it has been used year
by year during four generations.]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pickle for Bacon.</i>—Weigh each flitch, and allow
for every stone (a stone of meat weighs eight
pounds) one pound of salt, two ounces of bay-salt,
two ounces of saltpetre, and three ounces of coarse
brown sugar. Sprinkle the flitches with salt, and
drain them for twenty-four hours. Mix the salt,
bay-salt, saltpetre, and sugar thoroughly together,
and rub all well into the flitches, rubbing the ends
as well as the sides. Do this every day for a
month. Then hang up the flitches to dry, sewing
a bag of coarse muslin over each. [Do not use paper,
as it breaks in damp weather. Muslin is a far better
protector from the flies, which are always more
partial to salt meat than to any other.] The flitch,
from the Old English word, is one side of the pig.</p>

<p><i>To cure Pig’s Cheeks.</i>—Do not use any saltpetre,
but clear the two cheeks well, take out the bones,
rub well with common salt, let the cheeks drain,
and next day rub them again with salt, using a
fresh supply. Then mix four ounces of salt with
five ounces of coarse brown sugar, cover the cheeks
with this mixture, and turn them every day.
They will be sufficiently cured in twelve days.
If saltpetre is used the cheeks will be hard.</p>

<p><i>To boil a Ham.</i>—The great point in boiling a
ham is to boil it as slowly as possible. If a ham is
small and rather fresh, it will need soaking in cold
water for only eighteen hours before it is boiled;
but as a rule a ham should be soaked for forty-eight
hours, the water being changed three or even four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
times during that period. After the ham has been
soaked, scrub it well with a dry, stiff brush, so as to
remove all smoke and discoloration from the surface.
Trim off any ragged or untidy parts, reserving
them for the stock-pot. Now put the ham into a
ham-kettle or a large pan, and cover it completely
with cold water to the depth of one inch. Let the
water heat as slowly as possible, so that it may be
an hour and a half or two hours before it comes to
the boil. It is a good rule to allow twenty-five
minutes’ simmering to each pound of ham. Skim
off all scum as it rises. When the liquor is perfectly
clear put in one shallot, a stick of celery, two
turnips, two or three onions, and three carrots, also
add (in a muslin bag) a bunch of parsley, a sprig of
thyme and of marjoram, some chopped lemon-peel,
and twelve peppercorns. Cover the pan closely,
reduce the heat under it, and let the ham simmer
very gently for five hours. At the end of that
time lift the ham out, peel off the outside skin, and
trim it a little if this is needed. Brush the ham
over with thin glaze, or cover it with raspings of
bread, and set it in a slow oven to brown.</p>

<p><i>To steam a Ham.</i>—If the ham is quite small
this is an excellent way of cooking it. As soon as
the ham has been soaked, scrubbed, and trimmed,
put it into the steamer over boiling water. Allow
twenty-five minutes to every pound of ham, and
keep the water under the steamer boiling hard.
Either glaze the ham or cover with raspings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p><i>To pot Pounded Meat, Chicken, or Fish.</i>—Cook
the meat until it is very tender and easily separated
from the bones. Mince it, and then pound it with
a quarter of its weight of clarified butter, together
with pepper and such other spices and herbs as are
liked. Then fill the pots with the mixture, press
it tightly, and cover with clarified butter.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><i>TO smoke Fish.</i>—Having opened and cleaned
the fish, place them in salt and saltpetre,
eight parts to one, and leave them over the
night. Then wipe them, and hang them in a row,
by a stout wire passed through their eyes, over a
sawdust fire for about twenty-four hours.</p>

<p><i>To salt Fish.</i>—Having opened and cleaned the
fish, place them in strong brine for twenty hours.
Drain them and place them in jars, with layers of
salt between the several layers of fish. Securely cover
the jars until the fish are wanted. Soak the fish for
four hours in lukewarm water and dry before cooking.</p>

<p><i>To pickle Fish.</i>—Having opened and cleaned the
fish and removed their heads, place them in a jar
for twenty-four hours with layers of salt between
the several layers of fish. Drain them, and boil
them for two minutes with vinegar, onions, cloves,
peppercorns, and bay leaves. Place them in jars,
pour the liquid over them, and closely fasten down
the covers.</p>

<p><i>To pot Shrimps.</i>—Boil some shrimps, and as soon
as cold remove their shells. Mix with them a little
mace, cayenne, salt, and pepper, and pack them
tightly in the pots. Bake for about ten minutes in
a slow oven, and when cold pour over them a
quarter of an inch thickness of melted butter which
is just beginning to set.</p>

solution of sodium silicate (soluble glass). Eggs
thus treated keep perfectly fresh for six months, or
even longer.</p>

<h2>PICKLING VEGETABLES</h2>
<hr class="full2" />
<hr class="full" />


<p class="drop-cap">FOR pickling, the fruit, or leaves, or bulbs
should be in perfect condition and thoroughly
cleaned. Strong vinegar of good quality
should be used, and the spices should be
fresh and good. The mixing and heating of the
vinegar is best performed in unglazed stoneware
vessels; if these are unavailable, enamelled iron
pans should be used. Pickling consists in preserving
fruits or other vegetable products in spiced vinegar,
the details of the process differing slightly according
to the product to be pickled. To make the spiced
vinegar, place in a stoneware or enamelled boiling-pan
a quart of strong vinegar, from half an ounce
to four ounces of black peppercorns, a couple of
ounces of crushed ginger, and from two to eight
ounces of mustard seed. Boil this mixture for four
minutes. If liked, any or all of the following spices
may be added to, and boiled with, the vinegar,
in addition to those just named: from one to four
blades of mace, from two to ten cloves, from four
to eight allspice, and from two to eight grains of
cayenne pepper.</p>

<p><i>Implements.</i>—Unglazed stone jars are of all vessels
the most suitable for the containing of pickles, both
by virtue of their chemical composition, and on
account of their pleasant wholesome look. Glass
bottles are next best for the purpose. In any case,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the great thing to be remembered is that no metallic
substance must be allowed to come into contact
with the pickle or with the vinegar which is to be
used. Wooden spoons alone should be used for
mixing. For closing the mouths of the jars or
bottles, corks should be employed, and further
security from contact with the air should be ensured
by covering the corked mouths with tinfoil, bladder,
or parchment-paper. It is desirable that the vessels
be furnished with mouths of smaller size than is
usually the case, as the larger the mouth the
greater the risk of contamination by exposure to
the air.</p>

</div>

<p><i>To pickle Red Cabbage.</i>—Cut the cabbages into
shreds, place them in a large jar with plenty of salt
well intermingled. Leave them alone for two days,
then pour off the liquid, dry the cabbage for a few
hours in the air, pack it in the pickling jars to about
an inch from the opening, and pour sufficient cold
spiced vinegar to fill each jar completely, interspersing
some of the spices among the cabbage. Cork
and seal at once.</p>

<p><i>To pickle Shallots.</i>—Peel the shallots, and place
them in a large jar with plenty of salt well intermingled.
In two days pour off the liquid, and dry
the shallots in the air for a few hours. Then pack
them in the pickling jars, and pour boiling spiced
vinegar to fill each jar completely, interspersing
some of the spices among the shallots. Cork and
seal whilst hot. If the vinegar be poured off in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a><br /><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
week, reboiled, and returned to the jars, the pickle
will keep much longer.</p>

<p><i>To pickle Walnuts.</i>—Take walnuts gathered about
July, when still young and soft enough to be pierced
by a pin, and place them in a large jar, with plenty
of salt well interspersed and covering. In eight
days pour off the liquid, and wipe and then dry the
nuts in the air for a few hours. Pierce each walnut
with a stout needle, place them in the pickling jars,
and pour boiling spiced vinegar on them so as to fill
the jars. Cover with corks, and each week for three
weeks pour off the vinegar, reboil it, and fill up the
jars with boiling spiced vinegar. Then finally cork
and seal.</p>

<p><i>To pickle Gherkins.</i>—Place the gherkins in a large
jar with plenty of salt over and among them. In
six days pour off the liquid and add a little water to
it, so that it may be a brine strong enough that an
egg will float thereon. Boil this liquid and pour it
over the gherkins. In twenty-four hours pour off
the liquid, wipe and dry the gherkins in the air,
place them in the pickling jars, and fill the latter
with boiling spiced vinegar. Cork and seal. If the
vinegar be poured off in a week, reboiled, and again
placed in the jars, the pickle will keep much
longer.</p>

<p><i>To make a Green Tomato Pickle.</i>—Take a gallon
of green tomatoes and a quart of onions; slice them
and cover them with salt. In twenty-four hours
pour off the liquid, and slowly boil for about an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
hour the tomatoes and onions in a quart of spiced
vinegar, to which a pound of sugar and a tea-spoonful
of celery seed have been added. When tender,
take the mixture off the fire, bottle, cork, and
seal.</p>

<p><i>To make a Ripe Tomato Pickle.</i>—Substitute ripe
tomatoes for the tomatoes and onions in the last
recipe. Halve the quantity of vinegar, and omit
the celery seed.</p>

<p><i>To pickle Plums.</i>—Prick four pounds of plums and
place them in a fire-proof stoneware pan with two
and a half pounds of sugar. Carefully bring to the
boil, and add two-thirds of a pint of spiced vinegar.
Boil for a few minutes, take out the plums, cool
them, and place them in the pickle-jars. Boil up
the liquid again, and pour it whilst boiling over the
plums so as to fill the jars. Cork and seal at
once.</p>

<p><i>To pickle Samphire.</i>—Gather samphire whilst it is
green, about August, break it into sprigs, place in a
jar, and add abundance of salt over and amongst the
sprigs. In two days pour off the liquid, and dry
the samphire for a few hours in the air. Pack it in
jars, pour boiling unspiced vinegar over it so as to
fill the jars, and boil in the oven until the samphire
is green and crisp, and at once remove. Cork and
seal.</p>

<p><i>To make Nasturtium Pickle.</i>—Place some green
nasturtium seeds in a weak solution of salt for three
days. Then soak them in cold water for twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
hours. Strain and place them in small jars, and
pour boiling vinegar over them.</p>

<p><i>Some other Pickles.</i>—Young pea pods, young
French bean pods, cauliflower, unripe gooseberries,
and umbels of elderberry flowers gathered before
they expand, barberries (Mrs. Glasse recommends
that a little sprig of boiled fennel be placed at the
top of each jar before sealing), and sliced boiled beetroot,
are pickled as directed for red cabbage.</p>

<p>Unripe, but fully grown radish pods, are pickled
as directed for gherkins.</p>

<p>Onions and young mushrooms (which should be
rubbed with salt but not peeled) are pickled as
directed for shallots.</p>

<p>Small apples, pears, peaches, apricots, and damsons
may be used to make sweet pickles as directed for
plums. But apples, pears, peaches, and apricots
require to be peeled before being pickled.</p>

<p><i>To make Sauerkraut.</i>—Take a dozen fine, hard-hearted,
white cabbages, remove the outer leaves,
and shred the hearts into small shreds. Place these
shreds into a large tub, and over each layer sprinkle
a little salt (about six pounds in all). Press the
layers of cabbage firmly down, and, when the tub
is full, sprinkle salt over the top of the heap of
cabbage. On this place a piece of linen, and a
wooden cover on the linen. Weigh down the
cover by means of a large stone or other weight.
The cover must accurately fit the tub, and slide
down within the staves. The tub should then be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
placed in a warm room till fermentation has begun.
Wash and replace the linen cover every fortnight.
In three weeks the sauerkraut will be fit
for use, though it will keep good for more than
a year.</p>

<h2>CONDIMENTS AND SAUCES</h2>
<hr class="full2" />
<hr class="full" />


<p class="drop-cap"><i>MUSTARD.</i>—The simplicity of its manufacture
probably accounts for our persistence
in serving in our mustard-pots the never-varying
paste of mustard and water. Yet the infinite
variety of flavours which may be introduced into our
table mustards should sufficiently reward us for the
little trouble entailed in mixing them. As all these
made mustards contain spices or herbs which lose
much of their aroma by exposure to the air, they
should be put into jars and securely corked directly
they are made. Ordinary mustard also soon loses its
piquancy if left exposed to the air. It should therefore
be kept in a properly closed bottle or jar. It is
best to make small quantities of ordinary mustard
frequently, almost daily, as required.</p>

<p><i>To make Ordinary Mustard.</i>—Take a bare table-spoonful
of mustard, white and brown in equal
parts, and mix therewith one tea-spoonful of salt,
adding to the mixture, little by little, two table-spoonfuls
of cold water, stirring the while. Continue
stirring for a few minutes.</p>

<p><i>Mustard with Horseradish.</i>—Boil a table-spoonful
of grated horseradish in half a tea-cupful of water
for ten minutes, and allow to get cold. Then mix
the mustard as in the last recipe, adding the horseradish
and two table-spoonfuls of the water in which
it has been boiled instead of the plain water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p><i>To make a simple French Mustard.</i>—Proceed as in
the last recipe, except that a minced shallot should
be substituted for the horseradish, and that only the
water, having been cleared by straining, is added to
the mustard-flour. A tea-spoonful of good vinegar
is to be added to the mixture and thoroughly
incorporated.</p>

<p><i>To make a Spiced Mustard (Recipe 1).</i>—Take a
quarter of a pound of mustard-flour, pour over it
three small tea-cupfuls of boiling vinegar, keep the
mixture just below boiling-heat for about forty-five
minutes, add a salt-spoonful of ground ginger, half a
salt-spoonful of powdered cloves, and a salt-spoonful
of grated nutmeg, and heat for five minutes longer.</p>

<p><i>To make a Spiced Mustard (Recipe 2).</i>—Take a
tumblerful of vinegar, and place therein two salt-spoonfuls
of salt, a salt-spoonful of scraped horseradish,
and half a salt-spoonful of powdered cloves.
At the end of three days strain off the liquid and
add a sufficiency of mustard-flour—about three
ounces—to make a thick paste.</p>

<p><i>To make a Spiced Mustard (Recipe 3).</i>—Mix
together a tea-spoonful each of powdered mace,
ground black pepper, powdered dill seeds, and
powdered cinnamon, a slightly smaller quantity
of powdered cloves, a table-spoonful of powdered
tarragon leaves, and three pints of vinegar. Heat
for an hour, strain, and then mix with about a
pound of mustard-flour and a quarter of a pound of
castor sugar to make a thick paste.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><i>To make Frankfort Mustard.</i>—Mix together a
quarter of a pound of castor sugar, an ounce of
allspice, half an ounce of powdered-cloves, and a
pound of ground mustard—white and brown, in
equal parts. Mix into a thick paste with wine
vinegar.</p>

<p><i>To make Jesuits’ Mustard.</i>—Thoroughly mix ten
sardines, a quarter of a pound of ground brown
mustard, three-quarters of a pound of ground white
mustard, and two hundred capers. Make into a
paste with about a quart of boiling vinegar.</p>

<p><i>To make Mustard as at Düsseldorf.</i>—Take two
earthenware pans, and place in each a quart of
vinegar. In one place a quarter of an ounce of
thyme leaves, and in the other place three minced
onions. Let them stand for forty-eight hours.
Bruise half a pound of white mustard seed and half
a pound of black mustard seed, and put them in a
pan with a tea-spoonful of powdered cloves, a tea-spoonful
of powdered coriander, half a pound of salt,
and the strained vinegar. Thoroughly mix. Add
a little more vinegar if the mixture is too thick, or
a little more mustard if it is too thin. Parsley,
celery, or other herbs may be used instead of onions
to flavour the vinegar.</p>

<p><i>To make an Aromatic Mustard Powder.</i>—In
making a mixed powder of this kind, it is
absolutely essential to success that each of the
articles be thoroughly dry previous to being mixed.
A good result is obtained by mixing a quarter of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a><br /><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
pound of salt, a pound of mustard, half an ounce
each of dried garlic, dried thyme, dried tarragon, and
mixed spices—all finely powdered. The mixture
should be stored in air-tight boxes or bottles.</p>

<p><i>To make a Spiced Table Vinegar.</i>—Mix in an
earthenware pan two ounces of cloves, a quarter of
an ounce of mace, and the same quantity each of
orange blossoms and cassia bark. Pour a quart
of heated strong vinegar over the spices, and let
the mixture digest in a warm place for a week.
Strain, filter through filter-paper, and bottle.</p>

<p><i>To make an Aromatic Table Vinegar (Recipe 1).</i>—Chop
up one ounce each of bay leaves, leaves of
rosemary, and leaves of sage, and place them in a
fireproof earthenware pan; add thereto a quarter of
an ounce each of cloves, zedoary root, and chillis.
Pour on the mixture a quart of heated strong
vinegar, and let it digest in a warm place for a
week. Strain, filter, and bottle.</p>

<p><i>To make an Aromatic Table Vinegar (Recipe 2).</i>—Chop
up one ounce each of thyme leaves, basil
leaves, leaves of marjoram, leaves of tarragon, and
bean leaves. Add thereto half an ounce each of
chopped shallots and celery. Pour on the mixture
a quart of heated strong vinegar, and treat as in
the last recipe.</p>

<p><i>To make an Aromatic Table Vinegar (Recipe 3).</i>—Chop
up and mix half a pound of tarragon leaves,
and a quarter of a pound each of rocambole, shallots,
anchovies, capers, and bay leaves. Pour over them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
three quarts of heated strong vinegar, and treat as
in the first recipe.</p>

<p><i>To make Aromatic Table Vinegar (Recipe 4).</i>—The
leaves of any sweet herb, having been dried,
may be lightly placed—not pressed—in a bottle till
it is full, and vinegar poured over them and allowed
to stand for six weeks. It may then be strained
off and bottled.</p>

<p><i>To make Aromatic Wines.</i>—The leaves of any
sweet herb are to be treated as above, but sherry
is to take the place of the vinegar.</p>

<p><i>To make Curry Powder.</i>—Pound to a fine powder
and mix thoroughly together a quarter of a pound
each of coriander seed and turmeric, an ounce each
of mustard, ginger, and black pepper, and half an
ounce each of cardamom, cumin, and pimento.</p>

<p><i>To make Mushroom Catsup.</i>—Wipe, but do not
wash or skin, some freshly gathered, fully ripe
mushrooms, and place them in a jar with layers of
salt between the several layers of mushrooms and
over the whole, allowing six ounces of salt to a
gallon of mushrooms. Cover the jar loosely with a
cloth, and place it in a warm room until the next
day. Crush the mushrooms, place the whole in a
cool oven for half an hour, and strain through coarse
muslin. Boil the liquid with peppercorns, half an
ounce to the quart; mace, a dram to the quart;
cloves, a dozen to the quart; and bruised ginger,
half an ounce to the quart. When the liquid has
boiled down to a half, take it off the fire, allow it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
cool, strain through very coarse straining cloth, and
bottle in small, well-corked bottles. If these bottles
are treated as the bottles of fruit in fruit-bottling
are treated, the catsup will keep the better.</p>

<p><i>To make Tomato Catsup.</i>—Boil a quart of perfectly
ripe tomatoes with a table-spoonful of black
pepper, a salt-spoonful of salt, a tea-spoonful each of
ground cloves and allspice, and half a tea-spoonful
of mustard in a pint of vinegar for three hours.
Strain, and, when the mixture is cold, bottle and
seal.</p>

<p><i>To make Walnut Catsup.</i>—Boil a gross of soft,
young walnuts, crushed, two ounces each of ground
nutmeg and black pepper, half an ounce each of
ground mace and ginger, and fifty cloves, ground,
in two quarts of vinegar for forty minutes. Strain,
and, when the mixture is cold, bottle and seal.</p>

<p><i>To make a Piquant Sauce (Recipe 1).</i>—Boil half
an ounce of cayenne, half an ounce of cochineal,
half an ounce of mixed garlic, and half a dozen
cloves in a quart of vinegar for twenty minutes.
Strain, and, when the liquor is cool, add two ounces
of essence of anchovies, half a pint of an equal
mixture of walnut and mushroom catsup, and
half a pint of good port. Thoroughly mix and
bottle.</p>

<p><i>To make a Piquant Sauce (Recipe 2).</i>—Boil a
quarter of a pound of bruised cloves, a quarter of
a pound of minced shallots, and half an ounce of
cayenne pepper in half a gallon of vinegar for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
twenty minutes. Strain, and, when the liquor is
cool, add half a pint of an equal mixture of walnut
catsup and soy. Thoroughly mix and bottle.</p>

<p><i>To make a Piquant Sauce (Recipe 3).</i>—Boil a
quarter of a pound each of allspice, minced shallots,
and minced garlic, and two ounces of salt in a
quart of vinegar for twenty minutes. Strain,
and, when the mixture is cool, add a gallon
each of walnut catsup and mushroom catsup.
Thoroughly mix and bottle.</p>

<p><i>To make Anchovy Sauce.</i>—Heat, until it thickens,
a mixture of a pint of vinegar, a pint and a quarter
of water, two pounds and a half of butter, three-quarters
of a pound of flour, and thirty minced
anchovies. Rub the mixture through a coarse
hair sieve and bottle.</p>

<p><i>To make a Salad Dressing to be stored.</i>—Salad dressings
should be mixed freshly as required; but it is
sometimes thought desirable to keep a stock dressing
bottled and ready for all emergencies. Thoroughly
beat the yolks of three eggs, and gradually stir in
half a tea-cupful of olive oil, together with a table-spoonful
of mustard, a little pepper, two table-spoonfuls
of salt, and half a tea-cupful of vinegar;
adding, last of all, the well-beaten whites of the
three eggs. Bottle in well-stoppered bottles.</p>

<h2>PRESERVES</h2>
<hr class="full2" />
<hr class="full" />


<p class="drop-cap">IT is easy to make good jam at home if a few
simple rules are followed. Excellent jams
can, it is true, be bought, but they are generally
too sweet, a large proportion of sugar
being used in order to make the jam keep for a
considerable time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 1.</span>—Use only fresh fruit which has been
gathered in dry weather.</p>

<p>2. Allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar to
one pound of all fruit, except stone fruit. Stone
fruit requires an extra quarter of a pound of sugar.
Break the sugar small, but do not pound it; if the
sugar is pounded the syrup will not be clear. Use
the best sugar, as the inferior kinds produce much
more scum.</p>

<p>3. Never set the preserving-pan flat on the fire.
If you do, the fruit will stick to it, and burn. Raise
the pan on a trivet a little above the fire, and not
exactly over the hottest part. Stir the jam with
a wooden spoon all the time that the sugar and
fruit are boiling together. An iron spoon ruins
both the flavour and the colour of jam. Stir gently
at first, more quickly as the boiling of the jam
proceeds. Skim off all scum as it rises.</p>

<p>4. Put the fruit into the preserving-pan, sprinkle
in some of the sugar, and as the fruit juices, add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the rest of the sugar by degrees. When the sugar
is all dissolved bring the jam to the boil.</p>

<p>5. Never boil jam longer than twenty minutes.
If it is boiled too long the jam will be sticky, but
if not boiled enough it will not keep. When the
scum ceases to rise, put a few drops of the jam on
a cold plate, watch it for a minute, and if it sets,
and does not flow freely, the jam is done.</p>

<p>6. Warm the jam-pots before you pour the hot
jam into them; if you do not they may crack.
Fill the pots to within half an inch of the top, and
wipe off any drops spilt with a cloth wrung out in
hot water. If this is not attended to, there will be
great difficulty in scraping off the drops when the
jam has cooled.</p>

<p>7. The day after the jam is made, and when
it has become quite cold, lay a round of thin paper
on the top of each pot. Then take a sufficient
number of the vegetable parchment covers which
are sold for tying over jam-pots, soak them for a
minute or two in cold water, wipe them dry,
stretch one over each pot, and tie it round with
string. The parchment tightens as it dries, and
excludes the air from the jam. When the covers
are dry, write in ink on each the name of the jam
and the date.</p>

<p>8. Always keep jam in a cool, dry place. Damp
makes it mouldy, heat makes it ferment.</p>

<p>9. Never put one pot of jam exactly on the
top of another, but set one row of pots on the edges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of the row beneath, leaving a clear space in the
centre of each pot.</p>

<p>Different fruits require different treatment when
made into jam. Thus, strawberries must be carefully
stirred, raspberries must be mashed with a
wooden spoon; and both these fruits, being soft
and juicy, require less boiling than the drier kinds.
Dry fruits, such as apples, should always be put first
into a covered jar set in a pan of boiling water, and
kept there until they are thoroughly softened. Fruit,
with the exception of the very juicy kinds, takes
longer to boil than sugar, so that it is well to cook
the fruit partially before adding the sugar. Over-boiled
sugar spoils the texture of jam.</p>

<p>Rhubarb jam requires the addition of a little root-ginger
and a few strips of lemon-peel.</p>

<p><i>Orange Marmalade.</i>—Allow for every pound of
oranges one pint of water and three-quarters of a
pound of sugar.</p>

<p>Pare Seville oranges very thin, and boil the rind
till tender. Boil it in plenty of water for about
three-quarters of an hour. At the end of this time
the orange rind should be so tender that a straw will
pierce it. Then cut it into very thin strips about
half an inch long. Take off the tough white coat
of each orange, and throw it away. Then scrape
out the pulp and juice very carefully, and throw the
pips into cold water. When they have remained in
the water for a short time, squeeze them through a
cloth, and add a pint of the water in which the pips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
have been soaked to every three-quarters of a pound
of the sugar. The reason for steeping the pips is
that they yield a glutinous substance, which adds
richness to the marmalade. Boil the syrup for
twenty minutes, allowing three-quarters of a pound
of sugar and one pint of water to every pound of
orange pulp. Put the pulp and juice into the syrup,
and boil for half an hour, carefully skimming off the
scum as it rises. During the last five minutes add
the shreds of orange-peel. Put the marmalade into
pots, and tie them down next day.</p>

<p><i>Clear Orange Marmalade.</i>—In this marmalade
there are no shreds of orange-peel. Cut the oranges
in half after they are peeled and freed from the white
skin. Boil them for three-quarters of an hour,
allowing one pint of water to twelve oranges.
Strain off the juice, and boil it up sharp for ten
minutes. Allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar
to every pint of juice. Boil for twenty or five-and-twenty
minutes till it jellies. Four oranges make a
pound pot of marmalade. It is an improvement if
half the peel taken from the oranges is grated finely,
and boiled with the oranges.</p>

<p><i>Quince Marmalade.</i>—Scald the quinces, pare, core,
and quarter them. To four pounds of fruit add
three pounds and a half of sugar. Take three pints
of the water the quinces were scalded in, and boil in
it both the parings and the cores. Strain the water,
and add it to the quinces and the sugar. Let it
stand all night. Next day set the quinces over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
slow fire, and bring them very gradually to the boil,
skimming and stirring them all the time they are
cooking.</p>

<p>Crab-apples, Siberian crab-apples, and the fruit of
the Pyrus Japonica, or Japanese quince, all make
excellent preserve.</p>

<p><i>Crab-apple Marmalade.</i>—Parboil the crab-apples,
and pulp them through a sieve or colander. Pare
six large common apples, boil them till quite soft,
and pass them through the sieve, when they will
yield all the liquid they contain. To every quart
of crab-apple pulp add one gill of the liquid from the
common apples; and allow three-quarters of a pound
of sugar to every pound of pulp. Boil all together
for fifteen minutes, stirring the whole time.</p>

<p><i>Fruit Jellies.</i>—In making fruit jellies only the clear
juice extracted from the fruit is used. The fruit
must be softened by being placed in a jar set in
boiling water, after which the juice must be allowed
to drip through a hair sieve or a piece of canvas.
The fruit must on no account be squeezed or rubbed
with the hand or spoon, but it may be pressed down
by a plate with a weight set upon it. Boil the juice
for ten minutes, weigh it, and when it boils up
again, add half a pound of sugar to every pint of
juice. Then boil the whole sharp for five or ten
minutes more, skimming off all scum.</p>

<p><i>Clear Apple Jelly.</i>—Pare and core half a peck of
green apples, cut them up, and drop them as you
cut them into two quarts of water. Pare two small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
lemons, cut them up, removing the pips, and add
them to the apples, reserving the lemon-peel. Put
the apple-parings and the cores with the apples, and
boil all together very slowly till the fruit is quite a
pulp. Then strain it through a jelly-bag, and to
every pint of liquid add half a pound of lump sugar.
Boil the whole very fast with the peel of the two
lemons, skimming thoroughly all the time. It ought
to jelly in three-quarters of an hour; try it by dropping
a few drops on a cold plate. When sufficiently
done take out all the lemon-peel, and pour the jelly
into moulds or small pots.</p>

<p><i>Cranberry Jelly</i> can be made in this way from
the Russian and Swedish cranberries now sold, but
cranberries will require a pound of sugar to the pint
of juice. Cranberries should not be boiled longer
than twenty minutes.</p>

<p><i>Medlar Jelly.</i>—Gather the medlars when quite
sound, wipe them well, and let them stew in the
preserving-pan with just enough boiling water to
cover them till they are in a pulp. Drain the fruit
through a piece of canvas, but do not press the pulp.
Weigh the juice, and allow half a pound of sugar
to every pint. Boil it till quite clear, stirring and
skimming well. When it jellies, pour it into small
moulds, and let it set.</p>

<p><i>Currant Jelly (No. 1).</i>—Strip red currants from
their stalks, and put them into the oven. When
quite juicy, pass them through a hair sieve or a coarse
cloth. To every pint of juice allow a pound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
loaf sugar well beaten and sifted. Heat the sugar
on a dish in the oven, putting it between two
sheets of foolscap paper, and when the currant juice
has boiled for a couple of minutes, strew the sugar
into it by degrees whilst the juice is boiling hot.
It will jelly immediately, and gain flavour by
keeping. Put it at once into pots.</p>

<p><i>Currant Jelly (No. 2).</i>—To six pounds of red,
white, or black currants add four pounds of sugar
and half a pint of currant juice extracted from
additional currants. Stir the fruit well together in
a preserving-pan, set it on a brisk fire, and when it
boils up, pass it through a cloth into a basin with a
lip. Pour the jelly from the basin at once into
pots. Let the pots remain uncovered for nine
days, and then tie them up.</p>

<p><i>Blackberry Jelly.</i>—Take six pounds of blackberries
before they are quite ripe, pick them from
the stalks, and put them into a jar. Tie the jar up
closely, set it in a pan of water on the fire till the
blackberries become pulp. Then strain the fruit
through a cloth, and to one pint of juice add one
pound of sifted sugar. Boil it to a jelly, and pour
it into pots for use. Blackberry jelly is much improved
if half the quantity of blackberries is used
and the other half made up of bullaces or wild
plums. But bullaces are now rare.</p>

<p><i>Scotch “Jam Jelly.”</i>—This preserve is made from
the berries of the mountain ash, gathered when
they have become nearly (but not quite) ripe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Take off the stalks, and stew the berries in a jar set
in boiling water. They take many hours’ stewing
before they become tender, but in the end they
make excellent jelly. For the mountain-ash berries
allow a pound of sugar to a pound of pulp.</p>

<p><i>Damson Cheese.</i>—Stew the damsons till tender in
a jar set in boiling water. Rub them through a
coarse sieve to take off the skins. Take out the
stones, crack them, and blanch the kernels. Boil
the cheese for one hour. Then weigh it, and add
one pound of sugar to two quarts of the damson
pulp. Boil it, stirring it well till it is thick. Keep
the fire low, and boil the pulp very slowly. After
the cheese has thickened well, leave off stirring;
but it must boil quite to a candy, and may take
seven hours. Put in the kernels a few minutes
before the damson cheese is taken off the fire.
The cheese will be done when it leaves the sides of
the pan. A peck and a half of damsons will make
ten pints of cheese. Cover the moulds when cold
with paper dipped in brandy.</p>

<p><i>Brandy Cherries.</i>—To every pound of Morello
cherries, stalked but not stoned, add three-quarters
of a pound of best loaf sugar. Take a few cherries,
bruise them, and take as much juice from them as
will make the sugar into a very thick syrup. Fill
wide-mouthed bottles with the cherries, and prick
each cherry all over with a fine needle. Let the
syrup get quite cold, then pour it on the cherries,
and fill up the bottles with good brandy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Brandy Peaches.</i>—Peel the peaches carefully with
a silver dessert-knife, and as you do so put each
peach into cold water. Choose a deep stone jar,
put into it one pound of peaches covered with
three-quarters of a pound of sifted sugar. Fill up
the jar with good brandy. Set the jar in a pan of
cold water on the fire, and let it gradually heat till
the brandy is nearly boiling. Then let it get cold
and tie up the jar closely.</p>

<h2>THE STORING OF FRUIT AND HERBS</h2>
<hr class="full2" />
<hr class="full" />


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;STORE-ROOM for apples and pears
should be cool, though frost-proof, slightly
moist, and well ventilated, though free
from draughts. Adjacent apples should
not be in contact with each other. If very choice,
it is wise to wrap each apple in tissue paper. The
fruit should be hand-picked, and placed in the store-room
when quite dry, and any specimens that show
signs of rottenness should be removed directly they
are recognized.</p>

<p>Messrs. Bunyard, of Maidstone, have built some
fruit-houses which admirably fulfil the desired conditions.
The following instructions for erecting a
similar storehouse are given by Mr. George Bunyard.</p>

<p>First level the soil and dig out holes for the corners
large enough to admit brick piers 14 inches by 14
inches, or stones about 1 foot square; fix an iron
dowel in the centre to receive the corner posts of the
structure. Some provision for air (air-bricks), or an
aperture covered outside and inside with perforated
zinc, should be provided just above the ground line,
and if over 20 feet long an extra foundation should
be put in at the half distance to hold another
support.</p>

<p>Make the main posts 6 feet long, 6 inches
square, and prepare a hole in the foot to receive the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
dowel mentioned above. This will keep the framework
firm. The main ground plate should be
4½ inches by 3 inches, and the top plate of the same
size. Support and steady in the usual way with
quartering 4½ inches by 3 inches, and when this is
fixed, choose a dry day, and pitch, tar, or cold
creosote the lower plates and all the woodwork
2 feet from the ground to protect from damp: this
quartering should show an even outside face to
secure the matchboard.</p>

<p>The cheapest material for the outside covering
will be ¾-inch matchboard, and it may as well be
fixed outside the rafters as well. Pitchboard 4½
inches by 1 inch, rafters 3 inches by 2 inches.</p>

<p><i>Inside Bonds</i> from one side to the other, 4½ inches
by 3 inches. If stout they are useful to hold planks,
on which baskets can be placed overhead in the roof,
space. In order to receive the side thatch, a board is
attached round the door-plates and at the corners,
6 inches wide, from the ground to eaves, in which
the thatch is placed upright, and it is kept in position
by lateral splines of wood 3 inches by 1 inch.</p>

<p><i>The Roof Thatch</i> may be 18 inches thick on the
roof and 6 inches at the sides, and where it can be
procured, carex or reed is strongest and most
lasting, but it may be of wheat straw or heather.
The thatch at the sides should be 6 inches thick.</p>

<p>Both an inside and outside door should be provided,
and they must be made to fit closely to
exclude draughts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">ORR’S TRAYS FOR STORING FRUIT</div>
</div>

<p>In order that one may readily inspect the fruit,
windows of 21-ounce glass are inserted, and this
saves the use of a candle at storing time; but outside
shutters must be provided to keep the place as dark
as possible, and a fruit-house is perhaps better without
windows.</p>

<p><i>Ventilation</i> is provided by an opening under the
apex of roof at each end, 18 inches by 8 inches, a
small opening being left between the dairy shutters,
which can be stopped by hay or moss in severe weather,
and inside opening should be protected by perforated
zinc, fine enough to keep out wasps and flies;
another ventilator should be inserted about midway
under the lowest shelf, to open from outside by a
shutter, being covered inside by perforated zinc.</p>

<p>To protect the contents from rats, a ½-inch stout
wire netting should be fastened to the matchboard
outside beneath the thatch, so that an entry would
be difficult.</p>

<p><i>Inside Shelves</i> on which to lay the fruit are readily
fixed at the sides. First place uprights 2 inches by
1½ inch from the ground to the rafters, and then
attach bearers 2 inches by ¾ inch on this to the
quartering; 1 foot between the shelves is a very
convenient distance, the lowest shelf being placed
6 inches from the ground, making six all up to
the eaves. The shelves are made of ¾-inch
matchboard, should not quite meet each other by
¼ inch, so as to gain a slight circulation of air; upon
this place lengths of clean wheat straw, so that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
fruit shall not touch the wooden shelves. In the
centre of the fruit-house a narrow table with a
raised edge made of lengths of matchboard, set on
trestles, is useful to set up exhibition collections or
to show special samples. Baskets of fruit can be
set under this for early use.</p>

<p><i>Floor.</i>—The best possible floor is the natural
earth—paved surfaces are apt to become too dry.
The latest sorts should be stored on the lowest shelf.</p>

<p><i>Names.</i>—Provide slips of zinc 4 inches long, turn
up one end 1 inch, at an angle of 45°, and then slit
this angle three times, and bend it so that it will
hold a neat card; the other end can be slipped under
the straw.</p>

<p>From their fruit-house, constructed on these lines,
Messrs. Bunyard have put up 80 dishes of fresh
clean apples at the Temple Shows at the end of
May.</p>

<p><i>Pears.</i>—If pears constitute the bulk of the store,
the fruit-house should be rather drier and rather
warmer than in the case of apples. In either
case, the winter temperature should not fall below
40° F., and the summer temperature should not rise
above 60° F.</p>

<p>A very convenient method of storing apples and
pears is in flat trays, such as those known as Orr’s,
of which Mr. White, of Bedford, holds the patent
rights. The fruit is placed direct in these as picked
from the tree, and the trays are carried to the fruit-house
as fast as they are filled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Medlars</i> should be picked in November, preferably
after the frost has touched them. Their stalks
should be dipped in strong lime, and the fruits
buried in boxes of wet bran, no two medlars
touching, and placed in the fruit-house.</p>

</div>
<p><i>Walnuts</i> should be removed from their outer
rinds, and at once placed in an earthen jar. Cover
them with three inches of sawdust, and place them
in a cool cellar or fruit-house.</p>

<p><i>Filberts, Cobs and Hedge Nuts</i>, for storing, should
be gathered just before they slip their husks—though
they must be so ripe as to do so at the slightest
force. They should be dried before storing, or the
husks will become mouldy. They may then be
treated as advised for walnuts, or they may be placed
in a jar and sprinkled over with salt.</p>

<p><i>Gathering and Drying Herbs.</i>—Herbs should
usually be picked just before they flower, and, their
roots having been cut off, they should be tied into
bundles and quickly sun-dried. These bundles may
then be tied in paper bags and hung in a dry room,
or they may be powdered and bottled. Lavender
should be cut as soon as the flowers are fully open.
It should then be dried in the shade, and stored in
a dry room.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE value of fruits bottled whole in such
a way that they retain their natural form
as well as their natural flavour is becoming
more and more recognized, and fortunately
science has kept space with the spread of this
recognition, so that it is a perfectly simple matter
for the owner of the smallest garden to bottle
his fruit at the most trifling cost and trouble.
The methods adopted have for their object the
destruction of the germs present in the fruit,
through whose activity fermentation and decomposition
usually result, and the subsequent exclusion
of germs from the vessels in which the fruit
is being preserved. Glass bottles with air-tight
stoppers are usually employed for this purpose, and
several excellent varieties are in the market. In
practically all of them, the top fits on the wide
open mouth of the bottle and presses on a rubber
ring. The tops are usually either held down by a
metal screw ring or by a spring clip or wire bail.
Of the bottles here illustrated, the Climax, May
Queen, and Empress are manufactured by the
Rylands Glass Company, of Barnsby; whilst the
others are dealt in by Messrs. E. Lee and Company,
of Maidstone. Messrs. Lee are also responsible for
an admirable apparatus or boiling pan for sterilizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the fruit or other product. This apparatus serves
not only for the purposes of fruit bottling, but is also
serviceable for sterilizing milk and for certain other
culinary purposes. Select ripe fruit, removing any
that are unsound, and, having washed the bottles,
place the fruit therein—packing the bottles full to
the shoulder. Pour in cold water or cold syrup (from
a table-spoonful to half a pound of sugar to the pint
of water) so as to fill the bottles to the brim. Place
the indiarubber ring round the ledge on the neck of
the bottle, place the disc upon it, and loosely arrange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the screw-top, if that method be adopted, as free
outlet must be left for steam to escape. Take a
pan, such as Lee’s sterilizing apparatus includes,
and place cold water in it of such a depth as shall
reach the shoulders of the bottles which are now to
be placed in the pan. Heat until the water in the
pan has a temperature of between 155° and 160° F.,
and this temperature is to be maintained until the
bottles are removed. The bottles are to be lifted
out singly and the covers at once screwed down, or
locked by the spring or lever, according to the make
of bottle. They should be cooled as quickly as
possible. Apples and pears should be peeled, cut,
and cored, and placed in cold water directly they
are cored. All stone fruit should be stoned before
bottling. The time for which the bottles should
remain in the pan, at a temperature of 155° to
160° F., varies. Cherries, rhubarb, small plums,
gooseberries and currants require about twenty
minutes; tomatoes, half an hour; apricots, three-quarters
of an hour; and pears, an hour.</p>

<h2>THE DRYING OF FRUIT AND
VEGETABLES</h2>
<hr class="full2" />
<hr class="full" />

<p class="drop-cap">BY means of an evaporator, or drier, a number
of fruit and vegetables may be preserved by
the removal of the moisture which they
contain. Quite cheap evaporators are now
to be obtained, such as the <i>Quorn</i>, of Messrs.
Lumley, of the Minories, London. As the makers
of the various evaporating appliances supply full
instructions for their use, it is not necessary here
to give more than the briefest summary of the
treatment to be adopted in drying one or two
typical fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p>The method of preparing apples to be evaporated
is as follows:—</p>

<p>After the apples have been pared, cored, and
sliced, they are placed in a tub of perfectly clean
water, containing a small quantity of salt, which
prevents oxidation and discoloration. They are
then cut once vertically, and all bruises, specks, and
parings trimmed away to produce the well-known
apple-rings of commerce. These are placed thinly
on one of the trays of the evaporator and entered at
the lower end of the upper flue. Sometimes a little
sulphur may be sprinkled on the furnace with great
advantage for the purpose of bleaching the rings.
The first tray remains in the position just mentioned
until the second tray is ready to be placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
under the first tray which will be in four or five
minutes; the third tray is then filled in the usual
manner, and placed under the second tray, and
when the fourth tray is ready the first three trays
are pushed forward in the flue, and the fourth tray
takes the place of No. 1, and so on until the top
flue is full. On the arrival of the first tray at the
upper end of the flue, the contents are examined,
and those that are sufficiently dried are removed,
and the remainder turned over and returned down
the lower and cooler flue. In many cases, one
tray will hold the whole of the contents (which
are nearly dried) of two or three trays, the empty
ones being taken away to be again filled with fresh
fruit. The degree of heat used for drying apples
is from 175° to 240° F.; and the time occupied
varies from two to four hours, according to the
variety of the apple, but from two to two and a
half hours is the usual time. Whole apples require
a much longer time, eight to ten hours, according
to size and variety.</p>

<p>Plums are dried in the same manner, except that
they are placed in the evaporator at once. They
should be graded according to size, and be uniformly
ripe. During the process of evaporation
plums ought to be removed from the evaporator
once or twice for the purpose of cooling them and
toughening the skin, and so prevent bursting,
which they are liable to do, because the skin does
not allow the moisture in the fruit to freely escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
when first placed in the machine. As soon as the
plums commence to shrivel all danger of bursting
is past, and they may then remain in the evaporator
until dry. The time required for plums is from
six to ten hours, and the temperature requisite 240°
to 300° F. Plums may be steamed for a few
minutes and then split in half, thus entirely dispensing
with the cooling process, and considerably
reducing the length of time required in drying.
100 pounds of fresh plums will give about 30
pounds of dried.</p>

<p>Apricots are simply cut in two, the stones being
taken out, and the fruit then dried just like
apples, at from 240° to 250° F. They take from
two to three hours to dry. From 100 pounds
of the fresh fruit, 10 to 12 pounds of dried will
result.</p>

<p>Pears for drying purposes ought not to be quite
ripe. They are peeled, and either dried whole, or,
more generally, are divided, and the seed-vessels
cut out, the stems being left on. They then
require steaming for eight or ten minutes, and are
filled in from the bottom upwards. The temperature
used is 212° to 240° F., and the pears will
take five to seven hours to dry if divided, or seven
to nine hours if whole. From 100 pounds of
fresh pears 12 to 16 pounds of dried ones will be
obtained. When preparing the pears before drying,
the flavour will be improved if a little sugar
be added to the water in which they are cooked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and to this may be put the juice of the removed
seed-vessels and peelings.</p>

<p>Vegetables require, in addition to the peeling,
slicing, or cutting up, to be steamed or cooked for
five to seven minutes before they are dried. This
is necessary in order to keep their colour and to
prevent their becoming hard. When dried on a
small scale the cooking in boiling water is generally
sufficient. Like apples, vegetables are always
filled in from below upwards.</p>

<p>French beans are cut into strips by a special
machine, and cooked for a few minutes. A little
soda added to the water helps to preserve their
bright green colour. The time required for drying
is from three-quarters to one hour. Temperature
150° to 160° F. 100 pounds of fresh beans giving
10 to 12 pounds of dry.</p>

<p>Peas require simply shelling and a few minutes’
cooking. They should not be quite ripe, and are
laid thinly on the trays. They take from one to
one and a half hours to dry. Temperature 212° to
220° F. 100 pounds of green pods will yield about
10 to 12 pounds of dried peas.</p>

<h2>HOME-BREWED BEER</h2>
<hr class="full2" />
<hr class="full" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Blessing of your heart, you brew good ale.”</p>

<p>“It illuminateth the face, warmeth the blood, and maketh
it course from the inwards to the parts extreme.”</p>

<p>“A quart of ale is a dish for a king.”</p>

<p>“Sir, I have now in my cellar ten tun of the best ale in
Staffordshire; ’tis smooth as oil, sweet as milk, clear as amber,
and strong as brandy; and will be just fourteen years old the
fifth day of next March, old style.”</p></div>


<p class="drop-cap">ONE of the finest pamphlets ever issued in
this country is William Cobbett’s “Cottage
Economy.” Even now it affords good
stimulating reading, and might still serve
as a wise protest against the pietistic and other cant
of the times. The object of the little book was
first to emphasize the sound doctrines that no nation
ever was or ever will be permanently great if it
consists to any large extent of wretched and miserable
families; that a family to be happy must
usually be well supplied with food and raiment;
and that it is to blaspheme God to suppose that He
created men to be miserable, to hunger, to thirst,
and to perish with cold in the midst of that abundance
which is the fruit of their own labour. The
second object of the book was to convey to the
families of the labouring classes in particular such information
as to the preparation of food, the selection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of clothes and furniture, and the general management
of homes as his wisdom and sound judgment
dictated. All through the book runs a steady stream
of common sense far removed from the slushy cant
so prevalent in works of the kind. “A couple of
flitches of bacon are worth fifty thousand Methodist
sermons and religious tracts. They are great
softeners of the temper and promoters of domestic
harmony.” “Oak tables, bedsteads, and stools,
chairs of oak or of yew-tree, and never a bit of
miserable deal board. Things of this sort ought to
last several lifetimes. A labourer ought to inherit
from his great-grandfather something besides his
toil.” “Nowadays the labourers, and especially the
female part of them, have fallen into the taste of
niceness in food and finery in dress; a quarter of a
bellyful and rags are the consequence. The food
of their choice is high-priced, and the dress of their
choice is showy and flimsy, so that to-day they are
ladies, and to-morrow ragged as sheep with the
scab.” A healthy attitude towards the plain and
the wholesome and the genuine marks the whole
book. Among other things ardently desired by
Cobbett was the extension of the practice of the
home brewing of honest beer, and he denounced
the growing habit of tea-drinking with a vigour
that time and results have shown was not misplaced.
He looked upon tea-drinking as a destroyer of
health, an enfeebler of the frame, an engenderer
of effeminacy and laziness, a debaucher of youth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and a maker of misery for old age. And he could
scarce find adequate vent for his impatience of what
he rightly considered the everlasting dawdling about
with the slops of the tea-tackle, or for his pity for
the labourer who, instead of cheerfully and vigorously
doing a morning’s work on the strength of a
breakfast of bread, bacon, and beer, has to force his
tea-sodden limbs along under the sweat of feebleness,
and at night to return to the wretched tea-kettle
once more. How different, says Cobbett, is the
fate of that man who has made his wife brew beer
instead of making tea!</p>

<p>It has been said and often quoted that there is
good beer, and better beer, but no bad beer. The
present writer’s experience is that there is beer so
bad that few drinks can rival it for disagreeableness
in taste and effects; stuff which should never be
called by the same name as that transparent, brown
or amber, vinous fluid, “bright as a sunbeam,” free
from acidity, flatness and insipidity, which alone is
worthy the name of beer.</p>

<p>To make good beer requires good materials, care,
cleanliness, and method. Given those, failure should
be impossible. The water should be good, soft
water being usually to be preferred; the malt fresh
and full of flour; the hops bright, yellowish-green
in colour, with a pleasant brisk fragrance, and free
from leaves and bits of stem; and the various tubs,
boilers, and other appliances scrupulously clean.
The several temperatures should be taken with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
proper thermometer, and not guessed, as that way
many disasters lie.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 282px;">

<div class="caption">BARNETT AND FOSTER’S SPILE-DRAWER.</div>
</div>

<p>Spring and autumn are the seasons most suited
for brewing, as at other times it is difficult to keep
the temperature within the proper limits. Four
bushels of ground or bruised malt are placed in a
wooden “mash tun,” and twenty-two gallons of
water at a temperature of 170° F. are added thereto.
This is well stirred for half an hour, and then
another eighteen gallons of water at 170° F. are added,
and the stirring is continued for half an hour longer.
Cover the mash tun for a couple of hours, and then
draw off the infusion or wort through a hole in the
bottom, protected by a strainer, so that the malt itself
remains behind in the mash tun. Next add to the
malt thirty gallons of water at 185° F. Stir for half
an hour, let it stand for an hour, and then draw off
as before. Next add eighteen gallons of water at
200° F. to the malt, stir for ten minutes, and draw off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
half an hour later. The three washings may be all
mixed together if a good ale of average strength is
desired, or the third washing may be separately
treated so as to make a light table ale, or they may
be all three separately treated so as to form three
ales varying from very strong to very light, the
former having considerable keeping quality. In any
case, it is imperative that the minimum of time be
lost in transferring the wort to the copper. It
should be boiled for an hour and a half, and the
hops (varying from one pound in the case of a mild
table ale to six or seven pounds in the case of very
bitter ales, three pounds being a good average amount)
added, the boiling being continued for half an hour
longer. The wort is then passed through a strainer
into large, shallow tubs to cool, the depth of liquid
not exceeding four inches. It is next poured into
fermenting tuns (casks with one head removed do
nicely), which must not be more than half-filled.
The yeast (at the rate of a pint to the barrel of
thirty-six gallons of wort) is to be mixed with a
little of the wort which has been heated to 85° F.
As soon as this portion shows signs of general permeation
by the process of fermentation it is to be
added to the main body of wort, which is to be at a
temperature of 60° F. Stir it well, and then allow
it to stand. As soon as a yeasty appearance is
noticed in the head which rises to the surface, skim
it off every two days until no more yeast appears—usually
a week or more from the start. Then draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
off the clear ale into casks, filling them completely,
bung them securely, and place them in a cool cellar.
It may then be kept for from one to twelve months,
or longer, according to its quality and strength.
Ale or beer should be tapped a week before it is
required to draw any from the cask in order that it
may have time to settle.</p>

<p>Finally, the ale-wife may be referred to the appeal
of Dr. King—</p>

<h2>CIDER</h2>
<hr class="full2" />
<hr class="full" />

<p class="drop-cap">THE processes of cider-making are discussed
and explained by the present writer in
Thomas’s “Book of the Apple,” one of
the volumes in the series of “Handbooks
of Practical Gardening.” The following short
summary must here suffice. The apples, properly
selected and properly ripened by being thinly piled
on boards or straw in an airy, sunny place, should
be torn and crushed in a cider mill, and the juice
pressed out by means of a screw-press. This crude
juice should then be carefully strained through a
fine-meshed filter, in order to remove any cellular
tissue or other matter in suspension. The expressed
apple juice, having been freed by filtration
from undissolved solids, is next to be subjected to
the process of fermentation, that is, the conversion
of its sugar into alcohol. For this purpose, it
should be exposed to the air in large open vats, or
in casks with the bung-hole left open. All the
apple juice that is to be fermented in one vat or
cask should be placed in it within twelve hours
from the time of placing any therein. The specific
gravity should be taken daily by means of a brewer’s
hydrometer, about six-sevenths of the total solids
consisting of sugar. Approximately, the sugar gives
about half its weight of alcohol, and it has been
found that each decrease of one-hundredth in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
specific gravity of the fluid during fermentation
corresponds to the conversion of two per cent. of
sugar into one per cent. of alcohol. The scum
which rises to the surface of the liquid must be
skimmed off two or three times daily, and, as soon
as this frothy crust ceases to rise, the cider still in
process of active fermentation is to be drawn off
with great care by means of a rubber syphon or
pump and hose into perfectly clean casks. It is
well to rinse out the casks with water of about the
same temperature as that of the cider which is to
fill them, as a sudden drop of heat is very injurious.
The casks of cider should be kept at a steady
temperature of about 50° F.</p>

<p>If the open vat system of “purging” is unavailable,
then the cider is to be placed in casks with the
bung-holes left open, the cask being kept full to the
brim by frequent additions of clear old cider. The
scum in this case overflows at the bung-holes until
the purging process is complete. Subsequently the
cork is to be inserted, a bent glass tube being passed
through its centre, ending outwardly in a basin of
water. The excess of carbonic acid gas is thus
enabled to escape. As soon as the conversion of
sugar into alcohol is almost complete, the cider
should be carefully filtered at a low temperature by
means of a Filtre Rapide or other suitable strainer
(which must not consist of charcoal, sand, or clay),
and stored in clean air-tight casks in a cool place,
being previously pasteurized if the process be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
thought desirable or worth while. The cider must
then be left for a time in order to ripen, that is, to
develop bouquet and vinosity. If intended for
bottling, that process may be performed in the
following spring, or preferably in the following
autumn. All antiseptics, preservatives, and artificial
flavouring agents should be avoided as suggestions
of the devil. Scrupulous cleanliness of fruit, filters,
presses, mills, vats and casks should make the two
first-named possible additions unnecessary, and careful
selection of fruit should make the idea of
artificial flavouring an obvious absurdity.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><i>GENERAL Principles.</i>—In making wines from
fresh British fruit, the fruit should be quite
mature, yet as fresh in reality as in name;
and too much care cannot be taken in removing all
stems, leaves, unripe or diseased fruits, and other
refuse which would certainly affect the taste, appearance,
and keeping power of the ultimate wine. As
soon as possible after being gathered, the fruit is to
be placed in a tub or other vessel, and submitted
to the process of crushing or bruising. It is then
thrown into a wooden vat, the water added, and
the mixture allowed to stand for from one to three
days, according to the variety of wine and other
circumstances. During this period of maceration,
the mixture is to be frequently stirred by means of
a wooden stirrer. The liquid portion is then drawn
or strained off, the residuary pulp being placed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
hair bags and subjected to pressure. In the case of
raisins and other dried fruits, it is customary to chop
them into small pieces, and to soak them in water
for twelve hours before crushing them. The liquid
which is thus squeezed out is added to the rest of
the liquid and placed in another vat of wood or
earthenware, the sugar and cream of tartar being
added, and the whole well stirred for twenty
minutes. Yeast should then be added, when any
is required, and a temperature of about 60° F.
maintained. For about three days—or until most
of the sugar is converted into alcohol, as shown by
the saccharometer—the mixture is to be kept closely
covered by means of mats or other coverings. It
is, during this time, to be frequently stirred and its
surface skimmed.</p>

<p>It is then carefully to be run off into casks,
the latter to be filled to the brim, and the wine
allowed to work over or “purge” at the partly
open bung-holes. The casks are to be kept constantly
filled up with juice, and in about a fortnight
the rectified spirit is to be added, if such
addition is thought desirable. The casks are then to
be bunged securely and left for a month, when they
are to be again filled up and re-bunged. Six weeks
later they should be pegged or spiled, and a little
wine drawn off to ascertain if it be clear. If it is
quite clear, it may be racked off—preferably by
means of a syphon—into other casks or into bottles
for storage. If, however, it is not yet clear, the casks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
must be bunged up and left for another fortnight, or
the wine may be fined by the addition of isinglass—half
an ounce to the hogshead—previously dissolved
in a little cold water and diluted with a pint of
wine. This fining solution is to be thoroughly
mixed with the wine in the casks by means of a
clean broom-handle. In a short time the isinglass,
with the objectionable particles in the wine, sinks
to the bottom, and so enables the clear liquid to be
drawn off. It should then be stored for at least six
months in a cellar having a temperature of about
56° F.</p>

<p>Racking is best performed by means of a syphon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
though the wine may be—and commonly is—drawn
off by a tap. In the latter case the tap
should be inserted two or three days before the
wine is to be drawn off, thus affording it time to
re-settle. If it is not convenient to rack off the
wine into a second cask, it may be drawn into a
clean tub or vat, and returned to the same cask
after it has been thoroughly cleaned, and turned
bung-hole downwards over an ounce of sulphur,
which is to be burnt so as to fill the cask with the
fumes, the wine being at once returned and the
bung secured.</p>

<p>I cannot too strongly urge the reader to be loyal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to her country and to good taste in her wine-making;
and to confine herself chiefly to the
making of simple British wines from British fruit
with British names. Nothing is more objectionable
than to brand wines as British ports, British sherries,
English claret, and so on. It is almost as insufferable
as the labelling of writers as Belgian Shakespeares,
English Molières, French Fieldings, and
the rest.</p>

<p>I will describe the method of preparing a few
typical wines, and then indicate the several classes
in which the various British wines may be arranged.</p>

<p><i>To make Gooseberry Wine.</i>—Take six pounds of
perfectly ripe gooseberries, and treat them as directed
in the section on general principles. Allow one
gallon of soft, filtered, or distilled water; four
pounds of sugar, previously made into a syrup with
part of the water; and one and a quarter ounces of
cream of tartar. One or two ounces of rectified
spirits of wine may be added. Each of these several
ingredients is to be added at that stage of the fermentation
indicated in the section on general
principles.</p>

<p><i>To make Sparkling Gooseberry Wine.</i>—Proceed as
in the last recipe; but do not allow the fermentation
quite to complete itself before bottling the
wine. Add to each bottle a tiny piece of sugar
of about the size of a pea. Use good strong bottles,
and secure the corks by wiring them. It is sometimes
desirable to hasten fermentation in the vat by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
placing therein a small piece of toast spread on
both sides with ale yeast.</p>

<p><i>To make Lemon Wine.</i>—Take five pounds of
peeled lemons and the sliced peel of four lemons,
and proceed as in making gooseberry wine, but
allow only three and a half pounds of sugar and
add no cream of tartar. The pips should be removed
before the fruit is crushed.</p>

<div class="caption">A GROUP OF MODERN BOTTLES.</div>
</div>

<p><i>To make Cowslip Wine.</i>—Prepare a simple wine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
after the manner of making gooseberry wine, employing
one pound of raisins, four pounds of sugar,
and one ounce of cream of tartar to the gallon of
water. When active fermentation has nearly
ceased, a few weeks before racking, add two quarts
of bruised cowslip flowers. Then complete the
making of the wine in the usual way.</p>

<p><i>To make Rhubarb Wine.</i>—Take five pounds of
rhubarb stalks, cut them into small pieces, and proceed
as in making either gooseberry or sparkling
gooseberry wine, but no cream of tartar should be
added, and only three pounds of sugar should be
allowed to the gallon.</p>

<p><i>To make Date Wine.</i>—Take six pounds of stoned
dates, and proceed as in making gooseberry wine,
but no sugar is to be added.</p>

<p>The Merissah of the Berbers is a wine made from
dates to which a small quantity of maize has been
added.</p>

<p><i>To make Damson Wine.</i>—Take five pounds of
ripe stoned damsons, crush them and one-tenth of
their stones, and boil them in a gallon of water.
Then proceed as in making gooseberry wine, but
only allow three pounds of sugar.</p>

<p><i>Mead, or Metheglin</i>—for the distinction between
them is difficult to determine—was the chief alcoholic
beverage of the earliest inhabitants of Britain,
and the maker of the mead was the eleventh person
in order of precedence at the ancient courts of the
Welsh princes. Mead is usually supposed to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
been the fermented wine obtained from the liquor
formed by boiling honeycombs with water, whereas
metheglin was prepared from honey and water, with
or without the addition of hops or spices.</p>

<p><i>To make Spiced Metheglin.</i>—Boil for an hour a
mixture of one gallon of water and three pounds of
honey, taking off the scum as it forms. Allow the
mixture to stand for twenty-hour hours, add yeast
on toast, and proceed as directed in the section on
the general principles of wine-making. When the
active fermentation is subsiding, a few weeks before
racking the mead, hang into the liquid within the
barrel an open woven bag of mixed spices, an ounce
each of crushed ginger, cloves, allspice, and coriander
seeds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 294px;">

<div class="caption">A WINE FILTER-BAG.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p><i>To make Metheglin with Hops.</i>—Boil half an ounce
of hops in water, and allow it cool. Pour three
quarts of warm water on three pounds of honey,
stir, and allow the mixture to stand for twelve
hours. Then add the hops and the water in which
they were boiled, together with a piece of toast
spread on both sides with yeast. Allow the mixture
to ferment, and proceed as directed in the section
on the general principles of wine-making. Add
no ingredients beyond those named above.</p>

<p><i>Hydromel</i> is but another name for metheglin, the
word implying a product of the fermentation of a
mixture of honey and water.</p>

<p><i>To make American Mead.</i>—Take a barrel of cider,
fresh from the apple-press, and place therein twenty
or thirty pounds of drained honeycombs. The
next day add sufficient honey to raise the specific
gravity to such a point that an egg will float in the
mixture. It is then to be treated in the manner
suggested in the paragraph on the general principles
of wine-making, the only further addition being
half a gallon of rectified spirits.</p>

<p><i>To make Ginger Beer.</i>—Take five gallons of boiling
water and pour it on five pounds of lump sugar,
five lemons sliced and without their pips, five ounces
of bruised ginger, and five ounces of cream of tartar.
Strain off when the liquid is cool enough, and add
five table-spoonfuls of brewer’s yeast. Let the ginger
beer stand all night, and then strain again as carefully
as possible. Add the white of one egg before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
bottling the ginger beer, and put the beer in well-washed
champagne bottles. It will be ready in one
week. Brewer’s yeast should, if possible, be used,
but if none can be had, two ounces of German yeast
may be substituted for it.—<i>J. R.</i></p>

<p><i>To make Spruce Beer.</i>—Mince a quantity of young
sprouts of the spruce, and boil them with twenty
times their volume of water and an ounce of sugar
to the pint of shoots. Allow to cool and proceed
as in making ginger beer.</p>

<p>“<i>He wanted to make a memorandum in his pocketbook;
it was about spruce beer. Mr. Knightley had
been telling him something about brewing spruce beer,
and he wanted to put it down.</i>”</p>

<p><i>Certain other Wines.</i>—Currant (red, white, or
black), cherry, raspberry, mulberry, whortleberry,
blackberry, apple, grape, and elderberry wines are
made after the manner of gooseberry wine.</p>

<p>Sloe wine and green gooseberry wine, which latter
is not recommended, are made like damson wine.</p>

<p>Raisin and fig wines are made as date wine is
made.</p>

<p>Orange wine is made as lemon wine. Apricot,
clary, elderflower, ginger, juniper, and gilliflower
wines are made after the manner prescribed for
cowslip wine.</p>

<p>It is often thought desirable to add to wines the
flavour of spices or herbs other than those essentially
used in the making of the wine. In such a case,
the spices should be placed in a muslin bag and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
suspended in the wine when active fermentation is
subsiding, as suggested in the directions for making.
Commonly for elderberry wine, a mixture of crushed
ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and mace—of each half an
ounce to the gallon—is employed, and for whortleberry
wine a mixture of lavender, rosemary, and
ginger.</p>

<p>British wines have earned their bad name partly
through the careless manner in which they are
usually prepared, unclean bottles, corks, casks, and
vats being commonly used; and partly through the
absurdly short space of time allowed to elapse
between making and drinking. No wine is fit to
drink under two years from the time of its manufacture,
and most wines should be kept in bottle
much longer than is customary.</p>

<h2>THE DISTILLING OF WATERS AND
CORDIALS</h2>
<hr class="full2" />
<hr class="full" />

<p class="drop-cap">THERE is no occupation that comes nearer
to the work of gods than this occupation
of distilling. By the application of fire,
the purest of the elements, we separate
from gross, substantial bodies those subtle essences
which alone gave them distinction and charm.
The distiller can but smile at the impotence of those
who are unable to conceive the possibility of a post-physical
human existence, for, day by day, as he
stands before his stills, he sees the miracle performed
whereby the spiritual, the essential, is separated and
continues to exist apart from the material body in
which it previously dwelt.</p>

</div>


<p>The work is worthy of fine natures, and should
be undertaken with a mind full of reverence.</p>

<p>The practice of distillation dates back to very
early times, the oil of cedar mentioned by Dioscorides
having been obtained by boiling the oleoresin with
water, and condensing the vapour of the oil in
sheep’s wool spread on sticks placed across the top
of the vessel. But more elaborate stills, consisting
of cucurbit, alembic (or head) and receiver, were in
use in times not much more recent. Water-baths,
sand-baths, and other means for regulating the heat
applied to the body of the still were used as early as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a><br /><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the eighth century by the Arabians. It was at
about this time, also, that distillation of alcohol was
first practised.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 325px;"><a id="DISTILLING_BY_HEAT_OF_STEAM"></a>
<img src="images/i113b.jpg" width="325" height="452" alt="another still set above contained flames" />
<div class="caption">DISTILLING BY HEAT OF STEAM.<br />

(<i>From Peter Morwyng’s “Treasure of Enonymus,”
1559.</i>)</div>
</div>

<p>The distillation of pure alcohol from mixtures
containing it, is really only worth attempting under
somewhat elaborate conditions, and on a fairly large
scale. The distillation of essences and aromatic
waters, and of a number of liqueurs may, however,
be quite well practised on the domestic scale. A
perfectly made tin-lined copper still, with pewter
or copper head, neck, and worm, the latter fitting in
a wood or metal tub, is the principle article required.
It is desirable to have the cucurbit fitted
with a perforated water-bath, or metallic basket, to
contain the herbs or seeds which are to be heated
in the water or alcohol. These substances, thus
saved from contact with the inner surface of the
cucurbit, are not liable to burn or to stick. For
certain things, also, it is desirable to be provided
with an unperforated bain-marie when it is wished
not to subject the materials to a heat quite equal to
the temperature of boiling water.</p>

<p>All the joints of the still and the tubes connected
with it must be absolutely vapour-proof, or the
subtle gases of the spirits and essences will discover
the outlet and escape. The water in the tub containing
the worm must be kept cold, a few jugfuls
being drawn from its surface at intervals and replaced
by fresh cold water. Where possible, fresh plants
should be used for distilling purposes, as they more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a><br /><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
readily yield their essential oils than is usually the
case with dried plants.</p>

<div class="caption">SOME OLD DISTILLING VESSELS.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Aromatic Waters.</i>—For the distilling of simple
aromatic waters about a gallon of water should be
allowed to four pounds of the fresh herb, or one
pound of the dry herb, and about two quarts should
be distilled over. Peppermint water, damask-rose
water, orange-flower water, spearmint water, and
elder-flower water are prepared in this way. For
dill water, caraway water, fennel water, and cinnamon
water, a pound of the bruised fruit is mixed
with two gallons of water, and one gallon is
distilled over.</p>

<p><i>Rosemary Water</i> is made by mixing a gallon of
water, eleven and a half gallons of rectified spirit,
and fourteen pounds of rosemary flowers and leaves,
and slowly distilling off ten gallons over the water-bath.</p>

<p><i>Simple Lavender Water</i> is made in the same way,
substituting lavender flowers for the rosemary flowers
and leaves.</p>

<p><i>Beauty Water</i> is made by mixing half a gallon of
rectified spirits, a gallon of water, a pound of the
flowering tops of thyme and a pound of those of
marjoram, and distilling off a gallon.</p>

<p><i>The Distilling of Essences.</i>—The following is a
summary of the directions given by M. Deroy of
Paris, a well-known manufacturer of excellent stills
and other appliances connected with distilling, for
the distilling of essences or essential oils.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>The generality of plants give their maximum of
essence when they are dealt with in their fresh
condition. Some few, however, produce more
when they are dry. The produce of the same kind
may vary for divers reasons. The moment of its
harvest and the atmospheric conditions under which
it is effected, the nature of the soil, the quality of
the plants, and their more or less favourable exposal,
exercise a sensible influence upon the production.</p>



<p>Substances, previously either cut to pieces, incised,
rasped, ground, or crushed according to their nature,
are placed in water of ordinary temperature for
macerating.</p>

<p>The proportion of water used is mostly of three
to four times the weight of the substance. The
length of time for soaking varies from twelve to
forty-eight hours according to the dryness and the
divided state of the substance. Some light essences
extracted from fresh flowers (from roses, for example)
are obtained without previous maceration.</p>

<p>The matter is placed in the still with the water
into which it has been macerated. Sea-salt is sometimes
added for the purpose of retarding the point
of boiling. It is known that salted water only
boils at 108° Centigrade, say about 229° Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Those who follow this method, which is the one
most generally employed when it is a question of
exhausting plants which contain rather heavy oils,
certify that the essences separate themselves more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a><br /><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
easily if distilling is effected at a little over 100° C.
(water boiling-point).</p>

<p>Those who criticize this proceeding pretend that
it has the disadvantage of injuring the quality of the
essences obtained.</p>

<p>Thus the necessary quantity of sea salt required
for the complete salting of the water is rarely used,
which is to say about 40 per cent.; the majority of
distillers limit themselves, according to the case in
hand, to putting in 20 per cent. and sometimes only
from 12 to 15 per cent., considering this a sufficient
quantity to obtain a satisfactory result.</p>

<p>During the course of the distillation, the water in
the refrigerator should be renewed by ordinary
means when distilling essences which remain fluid
at a normal temperature. Whilst, as for the
crystallizable essences such as aniseed, China-aniseed,
caraway, fennel, peppermint, and roses, care should
be taken to keep the worm at about 30° or 40°
Centigrade.</p>

<p>Distilling can be effected by steam or direct fire
heat, by taking the precaution in the latter case
to place an interior grating in the copper so as
to hinder the substances from sticking to the
bottom.</p>

<p>The aqueous vapours mixed with those of the
essences become condensed in the worm, and the
produce of these condensations is gathered in a
special vase, known as a Florentine receiver, where
the oil becomes separated from the distilled water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a><br /><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
by reason of the different densities of the two bodies.
According to the nature of the essence, whether
lighter or heavier than water, this recipient is supplied
either in its upper or lower part with a side
spout, by which the overflow of the water passes
and leaves the essence to accumulate in the vase in
measure as it is produced.</p>

<div class="caption">STILL-ROOM OF THE LONDON ESSENCE CO.</div>
</div>

<p>Distilling is continued until the water runs out at
the outlet of the worm in a limpid state. By this
sign it is known that the distillation is no longer
supplying any essential oil to the recipient, as it is
precisely the presence of a certain quantity of oil in
the water which up to this moment gave it a milky
appearance.</p>

<p><i>Cordials.</i>—In the preparation of cordials or liqueurs,
scrupulous cleanliness is of the utmost consequence;
and the best of sugar, the purest of rectified spirits,
the best of herbs or essences, and distilled or filtered
rain-water should be used. Where possible, distillation
should nearly always be employed in the
preparation of liqueurs, lemon and orange liqueurs
being perhaps exceptions. If, however, distillation
is impracticable, prolonged maceration for a month
or more should be resorted to. In this case, in
adapting the recipes in this chapter, only enough
water is to be employed to make up the total to
the amount ordered to be distilled off. If, instead of
the herbs or spices themselves, it is decided to use
the prepared essences, care should be taken to obtain
essences prepared from the herbs, and not mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
chemical imitations. Messrs. Bush, Messrs. Stafford,
Allen &amp; Co., and the London Essence Co. may be
communicated with. The syrup is always added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to the distillate last of all, and should have been
carefully filtered through a clean filter-bag. If care
be taken, the liqueur will be clear as soon as made,
or at any rate after standing for a few days. Should,
however, this not be the case, the liquid may be
fined with whites of eggs, allowing one egg to three
gallons. In any case, the liqueur should be stored
for some months—preferably for a year or more—before
being used.</p>

<p><i>To make Champagne Cup.</i>—Mix in a jug, placed

four lumps of sugar upon it. Pare another lemon
as thinly as you can. Put the paring and the sugar
into a large jug, and pour in a quart of claret.
Mix all well together, and set the jug on ice for
one hour. Just before serving add a pint of sparkling
moselle and two bottles of soda-water. Put a
few sprigs of borage or of balm into the jug.—<i>J. R.</i></p>

<p><i>To make Coffee.</i>—Purchase whole, and preferably
unroasted, berries of good quality from a reliable
source. Roast freshly as required, grind as soon as
roasted, and make as soon as ground. Some admirably
simple coffee-roasters are now obtainable. In
the absence of a proper roaster, a frying-pan may
be used, a few berries being roasted at a time. A
very little butter should be placed in the pan, a low
fire should be employed, and the berries should be
kept on the move till they are of a light brown
colour. It should be remembered that a single
burnt berry will spoil the coffee. Coffee should be
most carefully strained, and therefore some form
of coffee-pot with percolator is desirable. Pack
the freshly ground coffee tightly in the strainer,
and slowly pour boiling water on it. As soon as
the coffee has percolated through, it should be
served. Boiling it drives off the aroma. A table-spoonful
of ground coffee should be allowed to each
<i>café noir</i> cup, or each large cup of <i>café au lait</i>. <i>Café
au lait</i> consists of an equal mixture of coffee and
boiled milk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p><i>To make Crambambuli.</i>—Boil half a pound of
sugar in a quart of ale. Beat six eggs with half a
pint of cold ale. Add the boiling ale, and serve.</p>

<p><i>To make an Egg-and-Brandy Mixture.</i>—Beat up
the yolks of two eggs. Thoroughly mix with a
tea-cupful each of brandy and cinnamon water.</p>

<p><i>To make Egg Flip.</i> (From “Oxford Night-Caps.”)—Egg
posset, <i>alias</i> egg flip, otherwise, in college
language, rum booze. Beat up well the yolks of
eight eggs with refined sugar pulverized, and a
nutmeg grated; then extract the juice from the
rind of a lemon by rubbing loaf sugar upon it, and
put the sugar, with a piece of cinnamon and a quart
of strong home-brewed beer, into a saucepan, place
it on the fire, and when it boils take it off, then
add a single glass of gin, or this may be left out,
put the liquor into a spouted jug, and pour it
gradually among the yolks of eggs, etc. All must
be kept well stirred with a spoon while the liquor
is being poured in. If it be not sweet enough, add
loaf sugar.</p>

<p><i>To make Egg Nog.</i>—Well beat the yolks of six
eggs, and mix them with half a pound of castor
sugar, stirring till the sugar is dissolved. Add this
to a mixture of a pint of brandy, a pint of rum, and
three pints of milk, stirring the while. Pour over
the whole the well-beaten whites of six eggs, and
lastly grate a little nutmeg over all. Having been
cooled over ice, this should be served in small
tumblers. If hot egg nog is desired, use hot milk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fruit Drink.</i>—Mash one pint of strawberries,
raspberries, currants, or mulberries in a pint of
water, into which the juice of two lemons has been
squeezed. Add a little sifted sugar. Strain through
a hair sieve. If not sufficiently liquid, add some
iced water or half a bottle of soda-water.—<i>J. R.</i></p>

<p><i>To make John Collin’s Gin Sling, or Gin Fizz.</i>—Mix
in a tumbler the juice of half a lemon, a
small tea-spoonful of castor sugar, and a wine-glassful
of Hollands or of Old Tom gin. Stir for two
minutes, then add a few pieces of ice and a bottle
of soda-water.</p>

<p><i>To make La Masubal, or Lamb’s Wool.</i>—Roast
half a dozen apples, having previously cored them.
Boil a small piece of crushed ginger, a quarter of a
nutmeg grated, and two or three ounces of sugar in
a quart of strong ale. Add the pulp of the roasted
apples, and serve hot.</p>

<p><i>Lemonade.</i>—To make one quart of lemonade
allow six ripe lemons, or eight if they are not juicy.
Take four good-sized lumps of sugar and rub the
outside of the lemons well with them, in order to
extract the “zest” of the rind. Pick out every
pip, and squeeze every drop of juice the lemons will
yield into a jug. Then add the four lumps of
sugar, and pour in nearly a quart of boiling water.
Cover the jug till the lemonade is cold. It is an
improvement to set the lemonade on ice, but do not
put any pieces of ice into it.—<i>J. R.</i></p>

<p><i>The Long Drink.</i>—Take a large soda-water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
tumbler, and bruise into it twelve or more strawberries,
or any fruit which will yield not less than
a table-spoonful of juice. Add a table-spoonful of
cream, and fill up with soda-water.—<i>J. R.</i></p>

<p><i>To make Mint Julep.</i>—Place four or five sprigs of
mint in a tumbler, together with a table-spoonful of
castor sugar and two table-spoonfuls of water. Stir
for two minutes, then add a wine-glassful of brandy,
and fill up the tumbler with shaved ice. The lip
of the tumbler may be rubbed with a piece of fresh
pine-apple.</p>

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;"><i>With spirits of balm and fragrant spices mix’d.</i>”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p><i>To make Mulled Ale.</i>—Boil a quart of ale with
a table-spoonful of sugar, a tea-spoonful of crushed
ginger, and two or three cloves. Beat up eight
eggs in a quarter of a pint of cold ale, and place in
a large jug. Pour the boiling ale on this mixture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and then pour the resultant to and from another
jug for some minutes in such a way as to froth the
mixture fully.</p>

<p><i>Mulled Claret.</i>—Put half a pint of claret into a
saucepan with a little water, six or eight cloves,
and a piece of cinnamon. Make it boiling hot.
Grate a little nutmeg and a little ground ginger
very finely into a jug, pour the claret in, and add
a lump of sugar which has been well rubbed on
the rind of a lemon.—<i>J. R.</i></p>

<p><i>To make Hot Milk Punch.</i>—Dissolve half a pound
of sugar in a quart of boiling milk. Add half a
bottle of brandy and a quarter of a bottle of rum,
grating a little nutmeg over the surface, and adding
the thin outer rind and juice of four lemons.</p>

<p><i>To make Milk Punch for Bottling.</i>—Place the thin
outer peel and the juice of three Seville oranges
and three lemons, with half a nutmeg grated, in a
bottle with a pint of brandy, and leave it to stand
for a few days. Then add a quart of brandy, a
pint of rum, a pound of sugar, and three pints of
water. Add a quart of boiling milk, and stir
thoroughly. Let the mixture stand for twenty-four
hours, and then strain through muslin, and bottle.</p>

<p><i>To make Hot English Punch.</i>—Rub twelve or
more lumps of sugar over the rind of four lemons
until the yellow part has been removed. Throw
the sugar into the jug or bowl, and make up the
weight of sugar to a pound. Add the juice of the
lemons and two quarts of boiling water, and stir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
for five minutes. Then add a bottle of brandy
and half a bottle of rum.</p>

<p><i>To make Cold Punch.</i>—Proceed as with hot punch,
but replacing the boiling water by cold water and
a few pieces of ice. The punch itself is better not
cooled over ice before serving.</p>

<p><i>To make Cold Gin Punch.</i>—Rub a few lumps of
sugar over the outer peel of a lemon, and place this,
with the juice of the lemon, in a jug or bowl,
together with enough sugar to make up to three
ounces. Add half a pint of gin, a wine-glassful of
maraschino, a pint of water, and two bottles of iced
soda-water.</p>

<p><i>To make Purl.</i>—Beat three eggs to a froth, and
well mix them with two ounces of castor sugar and
a gill of ale. Heat a quart of ale with a tea-spoonful
of powdered nutmeg and a table-spoonful of
crushed ginger. Slowly add the hot ale to the ale-and-eggs
mixture. Lastly, add a wine-glassful of
gin or brandy.</p>

<p>“<i>For the rest, both the tap and the parlour of the
Six Jolly Fellowship Porters gave upon the river, and
had red curtains matching the noses of the regular
customers, and were provided with comfortable fireside
utensils, like models of sugar-loaf hats, made in that
shape that they might, with their pointed ends, seek out
for themselves glowing nooks in the depths, where they
mulled your ale, or heated for you those delectable drinks—purls,
flip, and dog’s nose. The first of these humming
compounds was a specialty of The Porters, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
through an inscription on its door-posts, gently appealed
to your feelings as ‘The Early Purl House.’</i>”</p>

<p><i>To make Raspberry Vinegar.</i>—Pour two quarts of
best vinegar over one quart of raspberries picked
from their stalks but not mashed. Leave them for
twenty-four hours. Next day put the vinegar and
fruit on the fire till it just boils, and then squeeze
it through a cloth. Add two pounds of sugar, and
let all simmer for ten minutes. This quantity
makes six bottles. A gill of raspberry vinegar
mixed into a tumbler of seltzer water makes a most
refreshing drink.—<i>J. R.</i></p>

<p><i>To make Raspberry Vinegar (another recipe).</i>—Take
a quart of raspberries and place them in a
jar. Cover them with a pint of vinegar. In three
days pour off the vinegar, and replace the raspberries
by a fresh lot, again pouring the vinegar
over them. In three days pour off the vinegar
again, strain it, add a pound of sugar, boil for five
minutes, skim it, and bottle it.</p>

<p><i>To make Saratoga Cobbler.</i>—Half fill a tumbler
with shaved ice, and place therewith a liqueur-glassful
each of brandy, whisky, and vermouth, and four
drops of angostura bitters. Mix thoroughly, strain,
and add a slice of lemon.</p>

<p><i>To make Shandy Gaff.</i>—Pour into a tumbler
coincidently equal quantities of beer and ginger
beer.</p>

<p><i>To make Sherbet.</i>—Dry separately a pound of
fine castor sugar, half a pound of carbonate of soda,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and half a pound of tartaric acid. Add to the
sugar a large tea-spoonful of essence of lemon, then
add the acid and soda, and well mix. The sherbet
should at once be securely bottled, as the least damp
destroys its virtue.</p>

<p><i>To make Sherry Cobbler.</i>—Half fill a tumbler with
shaved ice. Add two wine-glassfuls of sherry and
a table-spoonful of castor sugar. Stir. This should
be served with straws.</p>

<p><i>To make a Syllabub.</i>—Place in a large basin half
a pint of sherry and three ounces of castor sugar.
Dissolve the sugar, and then add to the mixture a
pint of warm milk slowly poured from a height so
as to make a froth.</p>

<p><i>To make Tewahdiddle.</i>—“This is a right gossip’s
cup, that far exceeds all the ale that ever Mother
Bunch made in her lifetime.” To half a pint of
beer add a dessert-spoonful of brandy, half a tea-spoonful
of brown sugar, a slice of lemon and some
nutmeg grated. It may be drunk cold, or the beer
may be heated before mixing.</p>

<p><i>To make a bowl of Wassail.</i>—“<i>At night to sup,
and then to cards, and last of all, to have a flaggon of
ale and apples, drunk out of a wood cup, as a Christmas
draught, which made all merry.</i>” Boil a quarter of
an ounce each of bruised ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg,
and a couple each of cloves, corianders, and cardamoms
in three-quarters of a tumblerful of water for
ten minutes. Add a quart of ale, a bottle of sherry,
and from half a pound to a pound of sugar. Heat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
but do not get too near the boiling-point. Then
beat the yolks of six eggs and the whites of three
eggs, and throw them into the bowl. Slowly add
half the heated ale and wine, stirring all the while.
Bring the remainder to the boil and pour it also in
the bowl. Lastly, throw into the bowl six roasted
apples which had been cored and stuffed with sugar
and think of Puck’s confession—</p>

<h2>HINTS FOR REFRESHMENTS AT A
GARDEN-PARTY OR PICNIC</h2>
<hr class="full2" />
<hr class="full" />


<p class="drop-cap">IT may be useful to give a general idea of the
quantities required in providing for a party of,
say, eighty guests.</p>

<p>Five gallons of tea, allowing five ounces of
good tea to each gallon. Six gallons of coffee, half
to be served hot with milk, and half to be served
iced, allowing eight ounces of coffee to each gallon.
Three gallons of claret-cup, allowing for each gallon
four bottles of claret and four bottles of soda-water.
Twelve quarts of water-ice; six quarts to be of
lemon ice and six of strawberry ice. Twelve dishes
of sandwiches, of different kinds; these are sure to
be popular, and a tolerable supply should be kept in
reserve. Four dishes of rolled brown bread and
butter, and the same quantity of white. Eight
pounds of plum-cake cut up into small thick pieces.
Six pounds of freshly made sponge finger biscuits.
Two or more bowls of <i>macédoine</i> of fruit. Oatcake
cut into long fingers and spread with Devonshire
cream is popular, and so are small scones split
open and filled with Devonshire cream. A few
kinds of sandwiches suitable for garden-parties may
be mentioned here.</p>

<p><i>Salad Sandwiches.</i>—Use watercress picked from
the hard stems, mustard and cress, or shred lettuce
leaves. Spread the bread with <i>maître d’hôtel</i> butter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
For this, add to two ounces of butter the juice of
one lemon, a dessert-spoonful of chopped parsley
leaf freed from all moisture, a pinch of white pepper,
and a pinch of salt.</p>

<p><i>Cucumber Sandwiches.</i>—Pare the cucumber, and
just before the sandwiches are wanted cut it into
very thin slices. Place the cucumber between thin
pieces of white bread and butter stamped out with a
round cutter.</p>

<p><i>Rolled Sandwiches.</i>—Pound in a mortar two ounces
of cooked tongue or ham freed from skin and fat, a
quarter of a pound of cooked chicken or turkey, two
table-spoonfuls of <i>maître d’hôtel</i> butter, one ounce of
plain butter, and six table-spoonfuls of fine white of
bread-crumbs. When the mixture is smooth, add a
dust of pepper and a small pinch of salt, and pass
it through a sieve. Sprinkle a few bread-crumbs
lightly on a pastry-board, take a little of the mixture,
and pat it out with a knife dipped in hot water.
Make it two inches and a half long, and one inch
and a half wide. Trim the edges, and raise it
carefully from the board with the knife, rolling it
over as you raise it. If the mixture is too moist
add a few more bread-crumbs, but if it is too dry it
will break and not roll. Dish the rolls on a bed or
cress.</p>

<p><i>Green Sandwich Rolls.</i>—Pound the yolk of a hard-boiled
egg with a quarter of a pound of butter, six
sprigs of watercress, and six sprigs of parsley.
Blanch the watercress and parsley by throwing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
them for five minutes into boiling water. Press
them dry in a cloth, but do not squeeze them.
Then add a dust of pepper and salt, and six table-spoonfuls
of brown bread-crumbs; and when the
mixture is smooth roll it as in the former recipe.</p>

<p><i>Sweet Sandwiches</i> can be made of any jam or
marmalade. They are better without butter, and
the preserve should be very lightly spread. They
should be about four inches long and one inch wide.
Chocolate, melted in a little hot milk, and spread
between slices of stale sponge cake, makes a popular
sandwich.</p>

<p><i>Macédoine of Fruit.</i>—Put three lumps of sugar and
the thinly pared rind of half a lemon into a quarter or
a pint of water, and boil it for ten minutes. Then
add, if possible, twelve raspberries. If raspberries
cannot be had, add the juice of the half lemon. Let
it boil up, skim it, and set it on ice till quite cold.
Then add a dessert-spoonful of good brandy. Put
into a china bowl currants freed from their stalks,
raspberries and strawberries picked from their stems,
peaches and apricots stoned and cut into quarters,
black and white grapes, and a few mulberries.
Crack the stones of the peaches and apricots, peel
the kernels, and add them to the fruit in the bowl.
Set the bowl on ice. Ten minutes before the
<i>macédoine</i> is wanted, pour the cold syrup gently
over the fruit, and keep the bowl on a dish filled
with crushed ice. Help the <i>macédoine</i> with a soup-ladle
instead of a spoon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Travellers’ Sandwiches.</i>—These are so often
coarsely and carelessly made that the traveller on
whom the sandwiches are bestowed flies in disgust
to the dainties of the railway refreshment-room.
Sandwiches should be packed in the paper known
as “butter paper,” and if they have to be cut some
time before they are wanted, they should be kept
under a damp cloth, as they soon become dry if
covered with a dish. A small leaf of young lettuce,
or a little cress, improves most sandwiches.</p>

<img src="images/i157.jpg" width="375" height="431" alt="drawings of two mortars one with pestle" />
<div class="caption">SOME OLD MORTARS.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ham Sandwiches.</i>—Work a little mustard into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the butter you mean to use, and butter both the
slices of bread on one side. Lay a thin slice of ham
between the pieces of buttered bread, and press the
sandwiches under a light weight.</p>

<p><i>Beef Sandwiches.</i>—Prepare these in the same way,
but add a little grated horseradish to the butter as
well as the mustard.</p>

<p><i>Chicken Sandwiches.</i>—Use slices of chicken and
ham, or chicken and tongue, or pound the two
together. Spread a little <i>maître d’hôtel</i> butter on
the bread.</p>

<p><i>Gladstone Sandwiches.</i>—Use crisp toast instead of
bread, butter the toast with <i>maître d’hôtel</i> butter,
and cover it with finely shred celery. Cold game
is best for these sandwiches.</p>

<p><i>Travellers’ Rolls.</i>—Make dinner rolls the size and
shape of an egg, scoop out part of the crumb, and
fill the space with pounded cooked meat moistened
with <i>maître d’hôtel</i> butter, and well mixed with
shred lettuce, mustard and cress, or sliced cucumber.</p>

<p><i>Egg Sandwiches.</i>—Put some fresh eggs into water
which is already boiling fast, and let them boil for
fifteen minutes. Peel off the shells, cut the eggs
into slices lengthwise (not across, or the yolk and
white will not be equally divided), and place them
between slices of bread and butter. Mix both salt
and pepper into the butter before you spread it.
Or pound the eggs when they are cold and shelled,
pounding the white and the yolk together in a
mortar. Add a little butter, salt, pepper, and a dust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of cayenne, and spread the mixture on thin slices of
bread.</p>

<p><i>Cheese and Celery Sandwiches.</i>—Mix freshly grated
cheese with an ounce of butter till it becomes a
thick paste. Spread this on thin slices of bread, and
cover it with celery shred as finely as possible.</p>

<p><i>Beef Roll.</i>—This is excellent for a journey if cut
into sandwiches.</p>

<p>Mince very finely one pound of raw beefsteak
and a quarter of a pound of cooked ham. The
meat should be passed twice through the mincing
machine. Add to the meat one well-beaten egg
and two ounces of dried and sifted bread-crumbs.
Season with pepper and salt, but be careful not to
put too much. Then mix all well together with a
wooden spoon. Shape the meat into a roll, and tie
it up in a cloth, fastening the ends tightly. Boil
the roll for three hours, and glaze it. When cut
up into sandwiches, the mustard spread on the meat
should be mixed with water in which a little horseradish
has been grated.</p>

<p><i>Out-of-Door Meals.</i>—A good way of packing a
light summer luncheon is to take two strong biscuit-tins
of the two-pound size, then to line them with
lettuce leaves at the bottom and sides, and finally to
arrange packets of sandwiches in one tin, with more
lettuce to cover them. In the other tin set a loaf
of bread and a plain luncheon cake, with a good
clasp knife, and pack the space left with fruit and
whole tomatoes. Bottles of cold tea should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
taken in another basket, with a bottle or two of
claret or light beer, and a few tumblers. For a
boating-trip lasting a day or two the following suggestions
may be found useful. When you encamp
by the riverside, and your fire is burning, put on the
saucepan with ten potatoes roughly peeled, three
unpeeled onions, and a couple of carrots sliced.
Pour in just enough water to cover the vegetables,
and boil them for twenty minutes, keeping the lid
of the saucepan tightly closed. After twenty
minutes pour off the water, and put into the saucepan
the contents of a one-pound tin of haricot-mutton,
or beef, or Irish stew, and stir in two large
spoonfuls of Bovril or Liebig’s Essence of Meat. If
Worcester sauce is liked, add a tea-spoonful of that.
Stir all well together, and continue to stir the stew
over a hot fire for five or six minutes. This makes
a good dinner for two hungry men. If you can
buy from a neighbouring garden some young potatoes
and carrots use twenty of each. Do not peel the
potatoes, only wash them and rub them with a coarse
cloth. In washing up after such a meal use absolutely
boiling water, for merely <i>hot</i> water is of no
use. Fill your saucepan or cooking-pot with water,
and when it boils scour it round a few times with a
piece of house-flannel tied firmly to a stick. Do
the same to the frying-pan. Put metal cups and
plates into boiling water, also the blades of knives
and the prongs of forks (keeping the handles out of
the water). In this way they will soon be quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
clean, and after a final dip in the river, and a rub
with a dry cloth, they will shine like silver. If a bit
of bacon can be procured do not fry it, but toast it
on a toasting-fork before a clear part of the fire.
The rashers of bacon should be cut thin, and they
will be sufficiently toasted when the fat looks transparent.
A gingerbread loaf, made according to the
following family recipe, is useful for boating-trips,
as the longer it lasts the better it is. Two pounds
of brown flour, two pounds of treacle, a quarter of
a pound of brown sugar, a breakfast-cupful of cream,
two eggs, a tea-spoonful of carbonate of soda dissolved
in a little hot water, two ounces and a half
of ground ginger, and a little chopped citron. Mix
all well together, and bake in a moderately hot oven.</p>

<p><i>Cold Tea.</i>—Cold tea, properly made, is much
appreciated on journeys, and is generally liked by
shooting-parties on hot days. But good cold tea
cannot be made by filling bottles with the remains
of the tea at breakfast. Cold tea should be drunk
unsweetened, and if carelessly made it is flat and
unpalatable. Wide-mouthed glass bottles with
screw-tops, such as are sold for jam, are the best to
use. Cold tea should be made from the best tea
and freshly boiling water; it should stand four
minutes only, and should then be poured into the
bottles through a tin strainer. A couple of lemons
and a sharp clasp-knife should be packed in the
basket with the bottles of tea, and a little metal
box of sugar can be added for those who like it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Iced Coffee.</i>—Make strong coffee from freshly
ground berries, add cold milk and a little sifted
sugar. Put the coffee into glass jugs, and set these
on ice for at least two hours before use. If pieces
of ice are put into the coffee the flavour is spoilt.</p>

<p><i>Water Biscuits. Family Recipes.</i>—(1) One pound
of fine flour and two ounces of butter well rubbed
together. Add a pinch of salt. Mix with cold
water to a very stiff paste, and beat it well with a
rolling-pin. Break the paste into pieces the size of
a walnut, and roll each into a round. Prick each
biscuit with a biscuit-pricker. Put them on a very
hot baking-sheet, and bake in a very quick oven.</p>

<p>(2) Rub an ounce of butter into a handful of
fine flour. Make it into a stiff, smooth paste with
warm milk and the white of an egg beaten to a
froth. Beat the paste with a rolling-pin for half
an hour or longer, for the delicacy of the biscuits
depends upon the length of time they are beaten.
Then take small pieces of the paste and roll them
out to the size of a saucer. They must be so thin
as to be almost transparent. Bake the biscuits very
lightly.</p>

<p>Water biscuits are often liked at dinner instead
of bread or toast.</p>

<h2>ICE CREAMS</h2>
<hr class="full2" />
<hr class="full" />


<p class="drop-cap">VERY good small refrigerators may now
be bought, and are very useful both for
the manufacture of ice and of ice creams,
as well as for freezing puddings or cooling
drinks. The following recipes are for a few of the
more popular ice creams.</p>

<p><i>To make Strawberry Ice Cream.</i>—To three-quarters
of a pound of strawberries add half a
pound of sugar (or a pound of strawberry jam may
be used instead of fruit and sugar), and rub through
a hair sieve. Add a pint of rich cream, and very
little cochineal. Well mix, and freeze. Raspberry
ice cream may be made in the same way.</p>

<p><i>To make Vanilla Ice Cream.</i>—Make a custard
with the yolks of five eggs and a pint of milk, and
add two ounces of castor sugar and a little vanilla.
Cool, and partly freeze. Then add and well mix
half a pint of cream, and freeze.</p>

<p><i>To make Maraschino Ice Cream.</i>—Mix a pint of
cream, a quarter of a pound of castor sugar, the
juice of half a lemon, and two wine-glassfuls of
maraschino, and freeze.</p>

<p><i>To make Coffee Ice Cream.</i>—Mix half a pint of
very strong, good coffee with the yolks of six eggs,
six ounces of castor sugar, and a pint of cream,
and freeze.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p><i>To make Lemon Ice Cream.</i>—Rub castor sugar
over the rind of two lemons, making the sugar up
to six ounces. Mix this sugar with the juice of the
lemons and a pint of cream, and freeze.</p>

<h2>FOOD FOR INVALIDS</h2>
<hr class="full2" />
<hr class="full" />


<p class="drop-cap">IT may not be out of place to give a few well-tried
recipes for the benefit of invalids.</p>

<p><i>Beef-tea.</i>—Procure beef which has been
freshly killed. Take one pound of beef
free from the least particle of fat, gristle, sinew, or
skin. Mince it with a knife, not with a machine.
Put the beef into one pint of cold water, and stir
for ten minutes. Bring it to the boil, and boil it
for half an hour, never ceasing to stir it. Strain,
and add a dust of salt only. Serve with strips of
dry toast, and salt in a salt-cellar.</p>

<p><i>Cold Beef-tea.</i>—This can be digested by persons
who cannot take the usual beef-tea. Mince one
pound of raw beef as finely as possible. Pour upon
it one quart of boiling water. Plunge the jar in a
deep saucepan ready filled with boiling water. Set
it near the fire, but not so close as to make it
simmer. Draw the saucepan gradually away from
the fire, and let the beef-tea get nearly cold. Then
strain it through muslin, and after that filter it
through clean white blotting-paper. Serve cold.</p>

<p><i>Chicken Broth.</i>—Roast a chicken for fifteen
minutes, not longer. Cut it into slices, and put it
into a saucepan with three pints of cold water.
Season very lightly with pepper and salt. Bring it
gradually to the boil, and let it simmer very gently.
An old fowl will take from four to six hours, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
young one will need three hours. Strain, and take
off every particle of fat. The previous roasting of
the chicken is a great improvement. If the broth
is liked thick, simmer in it two ounces of crushed
tapioca or sago.</p>

<p><i>Nourishing Broth.</i>—Make the chicken broth as in
the foregoing recipe, but when the chicken is put
into the saucepan to simmer, add to it two pounds
of fresh shin of beef, without fat, and cook the
chicken and beef together. Or, if the chicken
cannot be had, use a knuckle of veal. Put the beef
and veal into five quarts of cold water. Add a
little salt, bring the broth to the boil, and simmer
slowly. The beef and veal must be simmered in
five quarts of water till this is gradually reduced to
three pints of broth. Strain, and remove any fat.</p>

<p><i>Chicken Food for an Invalid.</i>—Take a good
chicken and remove all the white meat. Cut up
the remainder into small pieces, and stew it in a
quart of water till it is reduced one-third. Let it
cool. Then remove every particle of fat or grease.
Put in the white meat of the chicken, and simmer
gently for fifteen minutes. Then pound it to a
paste in a mortar. Return the pounded meat to
the broth, and again simmer as gently as possible
for fifteen minutes more. Season with just a dust
of pepper and salt, and serve cold in a small mould.</p>

<p><i>Mutton Cutlet for an Invalid.</i>—Take three of the
nicest cutlets from the best part of a neck of
mutton. Trim one cutlet very neatly, and trim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the other two so that when placed together the
outer cutlets will project beyond the middle one.
Tie the three together, the cutlet intended for the
invalid being in the centre. Turn all three with
cutlet-tongs over and over till they are done. All
the gravy will be concentrated in the middle cutlet.
Send this to the invalid on a hot-water plate, and
use the other cutlets in the dining-room.</p>

<p><i>Savoury Custard for an Invalid.</i>—Take two eggs,
using both whites and both yolks, and the yolks
only of two more eggs. Beat them well with one
gill of clear beef-tea, but do not add any salt. Put
the custard into a well-buttered basin, cover the
top with a buttered paper, set the basin in a pan of
boiling water, and let it steam slowly. It will take
about fifteen minutes. Let the custard get quite
cold, then turn it out and cut it into diamonds
with a cutter. Serve salt and pepper with the
custard.</p>

<p><i>The Invalid’s Yorkshire Pudding.</i>—Mix the yolks
of two eggs into two good table-spoonfuls of flour.
Beat the whites of the eggs lightly, and stir all
together. Bake for ten minutes in rather a quick
oven.</p>

<p><i>Restorative Jelly.</i>—Take two ounces of isinglass
[in these days gelatine must be used], two ounces
of white sugar candy, and half an ounce of gum
arabic, grated. Steep these ingredients in a pint of
port wine poured over them in an earthenware jar.
Let it stand twelve hours. Put the jar in a saucepan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of cold water, and let the water get gradually
warm. Then simmer as slowly as possible, and
continue simmering till the isinglass or gelatine is
quite melted. The jelly will be thick. Do not
strain it, but break up a table-spoonful at a time for
use.</p>

<p><i>Rice Jelly.</i>—Well wash half a pound of Carolina
rice and boil it with a strip of lemon-peel for one
hour in two quarts of water. Pass it through a
sieve, and let it cool. When cold it will be a firm
jelly. Add one pint of milk to the rice jelly, and
boil all together till the rice resembles thickened
milk. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon. Strain
it, sweeten it a little, and serve warm.</p>

<p><i>Calves’-foot Jelly.</i>—This is much better when
the “set” of feet is prepared at home and not sent
in ready for use by the butcher. First wash each
foot separately and very thoroughly, then scald each
in boiling water, and scrape off all the hair. Remove
any fat from the clefts of the hoof. Put the
feet into a stone jar, cover them with one gallon of
cold water, bring it to the boil, and then either let
it simmer for six hours or tie stout brown paper
over the jar, and put it into the oven for three
hours. Then strain the jelly through a sieve into
an earthenware bowl. Let it get cold, then take
off the fat at the top. Break up the jelly, being
careful not to touch the sediment at the bottom of
the bowl. The four feet ought to yield about two
quarts of jelly. Do not clear the jelly, but add a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
little lemon juice as flavouring. Some invalids like
a little of this jelly warmed as broth; in this case
omit the lemon-peel, and use as flavouring a tea-spoonful
of thyme leaves finely minced and sewn
up in a bit of muslin, removing the muslin before
the jelly is strained.</p>

<p><i>Clear Barley Water.</i>—Wash one pound of pearl
barley very thoroughly, using fresh water two or
three times. Put the barley into a quart jug with
one lump of sugar. Fill the jug with boiling water,
and let it stand to get cold. The barley will
settle at the bottom, and the liquid will be clear.
Pare the rind of a lemon as thinly as possible, put it
into a breakfast-cup, pour boiling water upon it,
and let it stand half an hour. Strain the liquid,
put it into a glass jug, pour the barley water upon
it, and set the jug on ice before serving.</p>

<p><i>Toast and Water.</i>—This refreshing and nutritious
drink must be freshly made, as it soon turns sour.
Toast a thin slice of bread very slowly and carefully
till it becomes very hard and brown, but not
scorched or blackened. Put it into a jug, and pour
upon it one quart of freshly drawn cold water.
Cover the jug, and let the toast soak for one hour.
Then take out the toast, and pour the water into
the jug it is to be served in. Toast and water does
not generally need straining, but it must be served
quite cold.</p>

<p><i>American Crust Coffee.</i>—Cut some thin slices of
stale bread, and bake them in the oven till they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
quite dark brown. Pound the slices in a mortar.
Boil one ounce of bread-crumbs in half a pint of
water, using a small saucepan. Take it off the fire,
let it stand for a few minutes, and then strain the
liquid through a fine tin strainer into a tumbler or
breakfast-cup. Serve it hot. This is quite as
nutritious as toast and water.</p>

<h2>PERFUMES</h2>
<hr class="full2" />
<hr class="full" />


<p class="drop-cap"><i>To make Sweet-Jar or Pot-Pourri.</i>—Take six
pounds of bay-salt, beaten fine, twenty-four
sweet-bay leaves, torn into strips, a
handful of myrtle leaves, of the red part of clove
carnations, of syringa or orange-blossom separated
from the green calyx, of violets picked from their
stalks, six handfuls of lavender blossoms, a handful
of sweet verbena leaves, of thyme, of balm, of sweet
marjoram, and of rosemary. Dry all these on a sheet
spread in a sunny room. Then put them all into
a large china jar, sprinkling the pounded bay-salt
thoroughly amongst both flowers and leaves. In a
short time they will become moist. Stir the contents
of the jar well every day for a month, adding a little
bay-salt occasionally. Keep the jar in the sun, closely
covered with a china lid. When the pot-pourri has
been in the jar for a day or two, add four ounces of
orris root sliced, two ounces of beaten cloves, and the
rinds of three Seville oranges and of three lemons
finely pared, cut into strips, and well beaten. Cover
the jar as before. Jessamine flowers, myrtle or
syringa, or orange flowers, well dried in the sun,
can be added at any time to the pot-pourri. Never
adulterate pot-pourri by scents bought at a shop.—<i>J. R.</i></p>

<p><i>To make Eau-de-Cologne.</i>—Mix together a pint of
rectified spirits, an ounce of orange-flower water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
two drams of oil of bergamot, two drams of oil
of lemon, twenty minims of oil of rosemary, and
twenty minims of oil of neroli. Allow the mixture
to stand for a couple of months, thoroughly shaking
at intervals. Filter, if necessary.</p>

<p><i>To make Lavender Water without distillation.</i>—Mix
together a pint of rectified spirits, four ounces
of distilled water, three drams of oil of lavender,
three drams of orange-flower water, five minims
each of oil of cloves and oil of cinnamon, and four
minims of otto of roses. Allow this mixture to stand
for a fortnight, then filter through carbonate of
magnesia, and bottle. Keep for three months before
using.</p>

<p><i>To make Aromatic Vinegar for Smelling Bottles.</i>—Digest
in a bottle for four days, with frequent
shaking, a mixture of a pint of acetic acid (90 per
cent.), one ounce each of dried lavender flowers,
thyme, and rosemary, and twenty grains each of
powdered cloves and cinnamon. Strain, filter
through blotting-paper, and bottle.</p>

<p><i>To make Toilet Vinegar.</i>—Mix an ounce of pure
acetic acid with a pint of water, and digest therein,
for two or three weeks, four ounces of fresh, or two
ounces of dried, fragrant flowers or leaves. Among
the best for the purpose are rose petals, lavender,
elder blossom, rosemary, and thyme.</p>

<p><i>Scent Bags</i> may be made with almost any dry
fragrant leaves or flowers, such as the scented leaves
of geraniums, lavender flowers, rose petals, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
on. These are tied up in linen bags, and placed in
cushions, or suspended in wardrobes or cupboards.
A good recipe is a pound of lavender flowers, two
ounces of thyme, an ounce of ground cloves, and
two ounces of salt. A more elaborate recipe is as
follows: Grind into a coarsely powdered mixture a
pound of orris root, a quarter of a pound each of rose
petals, lavender flowers, and sandalwood shavings,
two ounces of benzoin, a dram each of otto of
roses and oil of cloves, a dram of musk, and half
an ounce of vanilla pods.</p>

<div class="caption">PERSIAN INCENSE BURNER.</div>
</div>

<p><i>To make Incense.</i>—Coarsely powder and mix
together a pound each of gum benzoin and frankincense,
a quarter of a pound each of cascarilla and
gum myrrh, and half an ounce of cinnamon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p><i>To make Aromatic or Fumigating Pastils.</i>—Mix
together the following ingredients, all having been
separately powdered: two pounds of charcoal, one
pound each of frankincense and gum benzoin, and
half a pound of gum storax. Add to the mixed
powders, four ounces of syrup, six ounces of tincture
of benzoin, two ounces each of oil of almonds
and essence of ambergris, and one ounce of essence
of musk. Make the resultant paste into cones,
adding a little warm water if required.</p>

<p><i>To make Aromatic Pastils. Another Recipe.</i>—Mix
together 125 parts of gum benzoin, 25 parts of
balsam of tolu, 100 parts of powdered sanderswood,
and 1 part each of nitre, oil of sandalwood,
cinnamon, and cloves. Make into a paste with a
solution of gum tragacanth (made by pouring 6
parts of warm water over 1 part of gum tragacanth,
letting it stand a few days and then straining), and
form into cones.</p>

<p><i>To make Aromatic Pastils. Another Recipe.</i>—Mix

<h2>SOME MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES</h2>
<hr class="full2" />
<hr class="full" />


<p class="drop-cap"><i>FURNITURE Polish.</i>—Mix together one pint
of linseed oil, half a pint of vinegar, and two
table-spoonfuls of turpentine. Rub it well
in with a flannel, and then thoroughly polish with
a duster. Never leave the furniture sticky, but rub
it till it is quite bright and clean.</p>

<p>The best polish for oak is made by melting a
pound of beeswax in a pint of turpentine. It must
be used when it is of the consistency of dripping.</p>

<p>If a polished table or tray has been marked by a
hot dish, cover the place with beeswax and turpentine
mixed together, and leave it for one hour.
Then rub off the beeswax with a leather. Should
the hot dish have scorched the wood, darken the
place with a little linseed oil, and then polish it.</p>

<p>For brass, use Putz’ German Pomade. Rub it
well on, and then polish the brass thoroughly with
a leather.—<i>J. R.</i></p>

<p><i>To destroy the Smell of Paint in Rooms.</i>—Place in
each room a pail of water in which two or three
handfuls of hay are immersed. At the end of six
hours the hay will have absorbed much of the smell
of the paint. Burn the hay, throw away the
water, and repeat the process as often as required.—<i>J. R.</i></p>

<p><i>To destroy Flies.</i>—Take half a tea-spoonful of
freshly ground black pepper, a tea-spoonful of brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
sugar, and a tea-spoonful of cream. Mix all well
together, and put it on a plate. The flies in the
room will soon disappear.—<i>J. R.</i></p>

<p><i>To destroy Black Beetles.</i>—The Union Cockroach
Paste, invented by Mr. Howarth, F.Z.S., for use in
the workhouse at Sheffield when it was infested
with black beetles, never fails in its effect. It is
sold in tins by Mr. Hewitt, Chemist, 66, Division
Street, Sheffield.—<i>J. R.</i></p>

<p><i>To make a Cement for China or Glass.</i>—Mix
thoroughly two and a half ounces of white of egg
with one ounce of finely powdered quicklime, carefully
adding an ounce of water and five and a half
ounces of plaster of Paris. This cement should be
used as soon as made.</p>

<p><i>To make Stick-fast Paste.</i>—Dissolve a quarter of
a pound of gum arabic in half a pint of water, and
carefully mix therewith an ounce of sugar and three
ounces of starch. Heat in a water-bath till it
becomes clear. Add half a dram of oil of cloves
and allow to cool.</p>

<p><i>To make Baking-powder.</i>—Mix together ten
ounces of bicarbonate of soda, eight ounces of tartaric
acid, and a pound of corn-flour, ground-rice,
or wheat-flour. Thoroughly mix the powders, pass
through a sieve, and store.</p>

<p>It is essential that the several materials used in
the preparation of baking-powder shall be separately
fire-dried with thoroughness previously to being
mixed. The presence of the smallest quantity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
dampness renders the mixture quite inoperative.
Baking-powder should therefore be carefully stored
in air-tight boxes or bins.</p>

<p><i>To keep Cut Flowers fresh</i>, they should be supplied
with fresh water every morning, when also a tiny
bit of the end of the stem should be cut off and the
whole stem gently wiped with a cloth. No leaves
should be left on that part of the stem which is
under water.</p>
